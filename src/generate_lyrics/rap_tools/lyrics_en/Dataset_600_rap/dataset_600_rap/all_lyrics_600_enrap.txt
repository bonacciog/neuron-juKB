Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things, yeah

Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who would have thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with cuffs and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah

My wrist, stop watching, my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

Wearing a ring, but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."
Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches
I'd rather spoil all my friends with my riches
Think retail therapy my new addiction

Whoever said money can't solve your problems
Must not have had enough money to solve 'em
They say, "Which one?"
I say, "Nah, I want all of 'em"
Happiness is the same price as red-bottoms

My smile is beamin', my skin is gleamin'
The way it shine, I know you've seen it 
I bought a crib just for the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it 
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it 

Yeah, my receipts be lookin' like phone numbers
If it ain't money, then wrong number
Black card is my business card
The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up like my ass, yeah

Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, give me the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set
If I like it, then that's what I get, yeah

I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it 
You like my hair?
Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it

Said she tired of little money, need a big boy
Pull up 20 inch blades like I'm Lil' Troy
Now it's everybody flockin', need a decoy
Shawty mixing up the vodka with the LaCroix, yeah
G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen, G-Wagen
All the housewives pullin' up 
I got a lot of toys, 720S bumpin' Fall Out Boy
You was talkin' shit in the beginning 
Back when I was feelin' more forgivin' 
I know it piss you off to see me winnin' 
See the igloo in my mouth when I be grinnin' , yeah

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 

Everywhere I go 
Catch me on the block like I'm Mutombo 
750 Lambo in the Utah snow 
Trunk in the front like that shit Dumbo, yeah
Cut the roof off like a nip-tuck
Pull up to the house with some big butts
Turn the kitchen counter to a strip-club 
Me and Dre came for the...
When I got guap, all of y'all disappeared 
Before I dropped Stoney none of y'all really cared 
Now they always say, "Congratulations," to the kid 
And this is not a 40, but I'm pourin' out this shit 
Used to have a lot, but I got more now 
Made another hit 'cause I got bored now 
Always goin' for it, never punt fourth down
Last call, Hail Mary, Prescott touchdown, ayy

Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Hunnid deep when I roll like the army 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow" 
Hunnid bands in my pocket, it's on me 
Yeah, your grandmama probably know me 
Get more bottles, these bottles are lonely
It's a moment when I show up, got 'em sayin', "Wow"

Got 'em sayin', "Wow"
Ayy, ayy, wow
Sayin', "Wow"
Wow

Look at my history
I'm tryna see what's different from that guy and the richer me
The only thing I see is custom owls from Tiffany
And some gunnas that'll hit you outta nowhere like epiphany
Really, that's it to me
Aside from the obvious, man, it changes in scenery
Testin' me gon' have my niggas testin' machinery
They say that they happy, my man, that's not how they seem to be
The boy, he wild and peaceful, rest in peace Teena Marie
Ethics and values, mob traditions, old fashioned
Monopoly action
Bronny buyin' up Brentwood like he still in Akron
A lot of pain, a lot of passion
A lot of relaxin' while other niggas is overreactin'
That's how we continue down the path of Jordan and Jackson
That's some insight for y'all even if no one's askin'
Last year, niggas really feel like they rode on me
Last year, niggas got hot 'cause they told on me
I'm 'bout to call the bluff of anybody that fold on me
I'm buyin' the buildin' of every door that closed on me
Yeah, Loro Piana and Brioni, the one and only
Champagne popper, the love doctor
Your baby mother call me when she lonely
My tailor see me twice a week, he like my homie
Forever grateful, forever thankful
Diamond necklace, but she wears it on her ankle
The bitch is trendy
My enemies send each other the texts that they could never send me
I'm bankin' two million a show for the residency
Nevada gaming commission in a frenzy
How much money can this casino lend me?
Rippin' markers up over shots of the Henny
Vivid memory, can someone send me a real nigga interlude?
To me, Benihana is pigeon food
This not a forgivin' mood
So much, we gotta count the twenties up in a different room
I am just a body that my brothers are livin' through
Keepin' my connections strictly physical
Everyone that's married is miserable
I know that that is not a lifestyle I can give into
The rise to the top of this mountain has been biblical
I don't carry cash 'cause the money is digital
It's the American Expresser, the debt collector
Hailin' all the way from the Mecca
Got something for Trudy and Rebecca
This shit could last forever
The mind controller, the Ayatollah
I built a bridge to success and had visions of me ridin' over
Step in the room and October gets a lot closer
Haunted houses
I don't know how to count in thousands, only millions
Now tell your friends I'm not the villain
Send 'em to Lagos or Turks and Caicos
Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago
Never go the same places they go
Separate vacations
A far cry from when Drizzy had slept in the basement
I was never on the path to get into Cambridge
I mean, I was good at doin' math, but I'm better with language
Borderline dangerous, approach with caution
I plan to buy your most personal belongings when they up for auction
Man, truth be told, I think about it often
The petty king, the overseer of many things
I wish that I was playin' in a sport where we were gettin' rings
I wouldn't have space on either hand for anything
West Hollywood, know my presence is menacing
Cosa Nostra, shady dealings
Racketeering, the syndicate got they hand in plenty things
The things that we've done to protect the name are unsettling
But no regrets, though, the name'll echo
Years later, none greater
Death to a coward and a traitor, that's just in my nature, yeah

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off 
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off 

You ain't got a clue, let's be honest
I had a couple seeds, I made a forest
I put in the work and take the profit
Lookin' at my girl like "What a goddess" 
Rule number two, don't make the promise
If you can't keep the deal then just be honest 
I could never die, I'm Chuck Norris 
Fuck the government and fuck Boris 
I'm a villain, killin' when I'm barrin'
Brothers in the hood just like the movie that I star in
Servicin' my whip, I phoned the boss to bring my car in
I could probably take your chick
But I just wouldn't 'cause she's jarrin', oh
I got the sauce , don't know what you thought 
Catch me up in the snow in my sliders and my shorts 
Chicks tryna get my brother Flipz to share his thoughts
I think he's tryna tell me I should tell her he don't talk
I don't fuck with her
Yeah, I used to hit it but you're stuck with her
Man, I wouldn't even try my luck with her
Gyal say I'm bougie , way too exclusive 
Chillin' in Dubai know I get it all inclusive 
Now may I ask if you can find it in your spirit 
To leave us all alone and go and mind your fuckin' business
Lookin' in the mirror sayin', "Mikey, you're the illest" 
When I'm James Bond, tryna live my movie like I'm Idris
So we telling 'em look

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop 
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop 
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots 
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off

I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop 
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots 
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off 

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop
So much Vossi I might open up a Vossi shop
Mummy sayin' that I need to get some sleep
All this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
And all this stress has got me wrackin' at my brain 
So tell these little fishes back up off my name 
I ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
Cah the rules are kinda different
When you're baddin' up the game 
Baddin' up the game, bad it up again 
Had 'em up before, have 'em up again 
Fake bruddas, man, your mandem will pretend 
Pussy by himself, he's battlin' with his friends
Aww, you man are so insecure, man it's a joke 
I need a Ballon D'or, 'cause I'm the GOAT 
If you believe in your source then raise a toast 
These are some genius thoughts so make the most
Told her "Save me some"
I need all the homage, could you pay me some?
Man a droppin' bangers on your baby mums
Gyals say I'm rude , they wanna see me nude 
My name stiff chocolate, I got nothing left to prove
I got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl
Which one of said that I would go to jail? 
Well, I guess you have to hold a L
Tell 'em "This is London city, we the hottest in the world"
What we tellin' em? Look

My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop 
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop 
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots 
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off 
My bruddas don't dab, we just Vossi bop 
I tell your girl to link me at the coffee shop 
Getting freaky in the sheets, we're takin' body shots 
Then I finish with a facial just to top it off

If you find time, we can run one 
Talk about some things, we can undo 
You just send the pin, I can find you

You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew

I knew, I knew, yeah I knew

Yeah
Circumnavigate the globe, as the cash grows 
Get a nigga whacked, like you get the grass mowed 
I'm talkin' slick, run ‘em with the big slime, nigga 
Could hit your bitch, you could never hit mine, nigga 
In my DM, they electric slide, nigga 
No catfishing, this is not a fish fry, nigga
Never switch sides on my dog
Catch a contact, hit your right, go to Mars
Everybody singing
How you come up out your face and say I hate the artist
Nigga, you done never heard
I left a flock of rappers dead and burned
A verse from me is like eleven birds
I did the math it's like 2000 dollars every word
I'm on the verge, I'll beat the charge
I killed some niggas and I walked away from it
Then I observe, just how you curve
And told them niggas that they gotta wait for it
I know, I know you in hot demand
I'm balling on a pussy nigga like Jauwanna Mann
I'm drowning out inside the pussy like I never swam

'Ey fuck your IG, I put somethin' on your sonogram
I'm the man 

You can meet me at the London
If you find time, we can run one
Talk about some things, we can undo
You just in the pin, I can find you
6'1" on the money, 9'2" 

You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew
I knew, I knew, yeah I knew

Pimp talk, church talk, I can make a brick walk
Up north, down south, Bankhead the ritual 
Hit it with a little water, stretch it like a vocal chord
STD, I run my ward, fuck a fed and his daughter
I'ma run the compound, ye I supply the sugar raisin bread 
I got a a main she gon' ride 
She took a quarter and she fled 
I'm in that mouth now, she gone ride 
I see the pain in shortie's light brown eyes 
I'm at The London with some big thighs
No fries, cheesesteaks with the fish eyes
Did your mama tell you when there's a fire, drop, stop and roll? 
I've been on the road like a pair of sprinters at Stop and Go's 
I could charge them like a Dodge, I'm a Demon

Got your broad in the garage eatin' semen 
Every time a nigga go back to the ward
Niggas act like they wanna start
And we leave them on the cement 

You can meet me at the London 
If you find time, we can run one 
Talk about some things, we can undo 

You just in the pen, I can find you 
6'1" on the money, 9'2" 
You just say the word and I'll run through
Two texts, no reply, that's when I knew 
I knew, I knew, yeah I knew

Aight, crushed down we get money

44 side 
89 fly, I might

Iceberg want a bag, bitch

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hits your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

She don't like her body, left the doctor with a new shape
Blowing up my phone 'cause she just see me with my new bae
Heartbreaker, ladies love me like I'm Cool J
She was tryna cling onto a nigga, but it's too late
Booked a flight to Cali, racks and condoms in my suitcase
And every single dollar in these bands gotta blue face
Diamonds in the Rollie, they in HD like it's Blu-Ray
The way that I been ballin' should make the cover of 2K
Show out for the summer I might pull up in a new Wraith
Dissin' on the gang that's gon only get your crew chased
And we hawk shit down, better tighten up yo shoe lace
Lil bro get up close let the Glock 22 spray

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hits your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

Oh-ohh-ohh, yeah
I call lil' bro, he said he ready for that shit

What you claim? You a lame, you ain't never put in pain

I be around some killers that go crazy for the gang

If I showed you all my charges, you won't look at me the same

Made some choices in my life I wish I never had to make

Lost my brother, seen him die and I just seen him graduate

Got that .40 on my side and I'm just rollin' past the jakes

Bro, my hands can do the job and I ain't talkin' masturbate
I was in and outta state 
'Cause I had a bag to make

I risked my life but it's alright'cause God ain't let me pass away

Fuck tomorrow, spin the block, just know we comin' back today

I call Polo, he come dolo, we get 'em the fast way

We pop out at your party, I'm with the gang
And it's gon' be a robbery, so tuck ya chain
I'm a killer, girl, I'm sorry, but I can't change
We ain't aimin' for your body, shots hits your brain
We come from poverty, man, we ain't have a thing
It's a lot of animosity, but they won't say my name
Them killers rock with me, lil' nigga, don't get banged
'Cause they'll do the job for me while I hop on a plane

Louis down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes

Gotta been looking like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, so is you
That's how I roll

If I'm shiny, everybody gonna shine

I was born like this, don't even gotta try

I like chardonnay, get better over time

Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie

Ain't my fault that I'm out here getting loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
Ain't my fault that I'm out here making news

No, I'm not a snack at all
Look, baby, I'm the whole damn meal 
Baby, you ain't being slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel 
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this 
Hold up, nigga, please
Don't make me have to take your bitch

Woo!
Y'all already know who I am? Right?
Mustard on the beat, ho
Let's go

Uh  no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash, but can't afford it 

You got the bag, but can't afford it 

Give me the beat, I ride it like a jetski 
So many bad bitches they harassin' me 
They like me 'cause I rap and be with the athletes 
Stop askin' me , I know they mad at me 
Hop in the coupe, then I slide like it's Vaseline 
West coast six--four jump like a trampoline 
Take a brick out, put it on a triple beam 
I'm not from Canada, but I see a lot of tings 
Dismantle her, I know how to handle her 
Light the candle up, make you put a banner up 
Toss a fifty up, make 'em tear the club up 

Took your bitch out the game,
I had to sub her 

Uh , no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 

Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash but can't afford it 
You got the bag but can't afford it 

Offset!
Pimpin' ain't easy, make her open up and eat it 
Stars in the ceilin' and my seats, they Tempur-Pedic 
I see them niggas watchin' and they plottin', tryna sneak me 
I can't hit a thot,
can't trust a thot, they tellin' secrets 
Big bank take lil' bank, lil' nigga 
Catch him down bad, that nigga cry a whole river 
Nawf on my back, I'm takin' care of the whole village 
Somebody got shot, what you talkin' 'bout, Willis? 
In the lobby with a brick, I'm Ricky Bobby with your bitch
I go Lawrence with the fit,

in the 'Rari with no tint 
I'm from the trench, I got the dirty money rinsed 
He was poppin' so I popped and prayed
to God, repent 

Uh , no Master P 
Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 

Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash but can't afford it 
You got the bag but can't afford it

T-Takeoff, no limit to the money 
I picked the gang up,
took a flight across the country 
I tipped the waitress, told her, "Keep the ones comin'"
Hit the store to get some Backwoods
and left the Wraith runnin', fuck it
Lookin' like they plottin', but we already on it 
In the lab with Celine like that bag that she wanted 

A lot of tings, ass bustin' out them jeans, make you want it 
Make you wanna spend a 50, hit the scene with her, don't it? 
Whole team full of queens, gotta keep their eyes on me 
It's a snake in disguise, prolly wanna slide on me 
I bet they ride on 'em when I put that prize on 'em 
Ten bad bitches, rotate 'em, got five of 'em 

Uh , no Master P 

Ten bad bitches and they after me 
One bad bitch look like a masterpiece 
Lookin' for a dunk, like a athlete 
Big drip, what you call it? 
Ice chain, pure water 
You got the cash but can't afford it 
You got the bag but can't afford it

Two-step 
Two-step

Two-step 
Goodnight

I just checked my balance
I'll probably pull up to your hood
And come buy me a nigga 
You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga 
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney 
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winning
Don't make me go hit the bank
And take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different 
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' 
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children 
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million 
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you 
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' 
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga 
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas 
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out guns
I'm gon' shot me a nigga 
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga 
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun
He just pull it out in his pictures 

Hah

Talkin' 'bout, "Shit I'm gon' pop that" 
Got like thirty-two thousand in one of my pockets
The other one, that's where the Glock at 
You little nigga wanna be internet gangster
Man, tell all these little niggas stop that 
Beat and burnt me a nigga in front of the store
Where your mammy and grandmama shop at

Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertable
Push me a lil' nigga top back 
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music 
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusing
I don't know what these niggas is thinking about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it 
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor
'Member I used to cheat off of pretty bitch test
All the teachers, they thought I was stupid 
Was expecting the Boxer to pull up on a trap
Man, this nigga pulled up on a scooter 

Hah
Pack in the mail, it's gone 
She like how I smell, cologne

You got me some type of way 
Ain't used to feelin' this way 
I do not know what to say 
But I know I shouldn't think about it
Took one fuckin' look at your face 
Now I wanna know how you taste 
Usually don't give it away 
But you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it

Then I realize she's right there
And I'm at home like, "Damn, this ain't fair"

Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You can hit in the mornin' 
Yeah, yeah, like it's yours
I know it ain't right
But I don't care 
Break up with your girlfriend
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored

This shit always happens to me 
Why can't we just play for keeps? 
Practically on my knees 
But I know I shouldn't think about it
You know what you're doin' to me
You're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah
Actin' all innocent, please
When I know you're out here thinkin' 'bout it

Then you realize she's right there 
And you're at home like, "Damn, she can't compare"

Break up with your girlfriend

You can say I'm hatin' if you want to
But I only hate on her 'cause I want you
Say I'm trippin' if you feel that
But you without me ain't right 
You can call me crazy 'cause I want you
And I never even ever fuckin' met you
Say I'm trippin' and it ain't right
But you without me ain't nice 

Break up with your girlfriend 
Yeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored
You can hit in the mornin'

New Bentley truck cost a quarter

Pussy still wet like Florida 
Everyone drop on the floor

Done with the talkin', I'm open to violence

Son, you know why you the greatest alive?
Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga
Hahahahahaha


Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies

I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika
Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that  and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap 

Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back

Chika-chika-chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said "Rover" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go  like the Dobermann said
I still think the  would go over your head 
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm about to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop

Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'
Flamminababbitapannitajampkin, dammit, a can of pada-

Watch me, take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week wasting time with people I don't like
I think something's fucking wrong with me

Drown myself in alcohol, that shit never helps at all
I might say some stupid things tonight when you pick up this call
I've been hearing silence on the other side for way too long
I can taste it on my tongue, I can tell that something's wrong but
I guess it's just my life and I can take it if I wanna
But I cannot hide in hills of California
Because these hills have eyes, and I got paranoia
I hurt myself sometimes, is that too scary for you?

Watch me, take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me

Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
Roll me up and smoke me, love
And we can fly into the night
You take drugs  to let go 
And figure it all out on your own
You take drugs  on gravestones 
To figure it all out on your own

Watch me take a good thing and fuck it all up in one night
Catch me, I'm the one on the run away from the headlights
No sleep, up all week wasting time with people I don't like
I think that something's fucking wrong with me

You'll find me alone at midnight
Inside my mind, tryna get things right

They want to keep you calling
So you don't wake in the morning

Goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, yeah
Find me alone at midnight 
Inside my mind, tryna get things right 
They want to keep you calling 
So you don't wake in the morning

Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Visions I vandalize
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by one

Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse 

You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty

You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by one

Crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by, one by one, one by, one by
You should see me in a crown 
Your silence is my favorite sound 
Watch me make 'em bow

Tu jeva me vio y se fue de pecho como Jimmy Snuka 
Te vamos tumbar la peluca
Y arranca pal' carajo, cabrón, que a ti no te vo'a pasar la hookah 

Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada 
Pa-pa-pa-parazzi, like I'm Lady Gaga 
Y no te me hagas 
Que en cover de Billboard tú has visto mi cara 
No salgo de tu mente 
Donde quieras que viajes has escuchado "Mi Gente"

Yo no soy high , soy como el Testarossa 
Yo soy el que se la vive y también el que la goza 
Es la cosa, mami es la cosa 
El que mira sufre y el que toca goza 

I said I like it like that
I said I like it like that 
I said I like it like that 
I said I like it like that

Diamond district in the jag 
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang 
Drop the top and blow the brains, wouh 
Oh he's so handsome, what's his name?

I see wrist bust-down nigga, twenty on each
That's a big back baby come and fling it on me
Rosé by the case for that Bon Appétit

Watch your girl, 'cause she digging the drip
If she with me then she ain't a regular bitch
Rock my world, she a free l'il minx
We got a freezer in the Range shorty come take a sip
Gucci on her hip with the Fashionova thick
Can you do a trick? Can you do it on a dick?

That's a big fat couple racks spend it on a coat
Meet me on a low, I got money that I'm tryna blow
Money that I'm tryna throw, six figures on a dilly
Feel like Biggaveli now I got a l'il Kimmy
Yo feel like Makaveli when I pull up in the city
Bust a dance for me I ain't talkin' 'bout the shiggy

Came from Nottingham to Manny with a baddy in the coupe
I'm nineteen she's thirty-two, to her I'm actually a youth

Heh, wrap another zoot
Tell her turn around, show me what the back of it can do
Loosen up, shake it off, back it up a few
Them other girls are too jealous, they ain't flashier than you 
Bend it over, push it on me, then rotate your hips 

When we fucked she let me take a pic
One chance, are you leaving or are you taking it?
I got some white chocolate, I promise you'll like the taste of it 
Blitzed a couple bottles now I'm zoned out
Mandem moving mad, more time are getting thrown out
Hold that position, quick let me get my phone out
Babe just do me a favour and-

What up, world?
It's your boy, just one of the guys down here
Well, I could be more specific
Uh, I'm a human
And I just wanted to, you know
For the sake of all of us earthlings out there
Just wanted to say

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home

Hi, I'm a baboon
I'm like a man, just less advanced and my anus is huge

Hey, I'm a zebra
No one knows what I do, but I look pretty cool
Am I white or black?

I'm a lion cub, and I'm always getting licked 

How's it going? I'm a cow 
You drink milk from my tits 

I'm a fat, fucking pig

I'm a common fungus

I'm a disgruntled skunk, shoot you out my butthole

I'm a marijuana plant, I can get you fucked up

And I'm Kanye West

We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth, it is our planet
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

Ba-dum-da-dum-dum, ba-dum-da-di
We are the vultures, feed on the dead

We're just some rhinos, horny as heck

I'm just a giraffe, what's with this neck?

Hippity-hop, I'm a kangaroo
I hop all day, up and down with you

I'm an elephant, I got junk in my trunk

What the fuck? I'm a clam!

I'm a wolf. Howl!

I'm a squirrel, lookin' for my next nut

And I'm a pony, just a freak horse, heh-heh-heh
But, uh, c'mon, get on 
Giddee-up, let's ride

I'm HPV, don't let me in

I'm a koala and I sleep all the time
So what? It's cute

We love you, India

We love you, Africa

We love the Chinese

We forgive you, Germany

Earth, it is our planet 
We love the Earth 
It is our home 
We love the Earth, it is our planet 
We love the Earth, it is our home
We love the Earth

I'm a man 
Can you hear me?

I've trudged the Earth for so damn long
And still don't know shit

I hope it's not a simulation 
Give each other names like Ahmed and Pedro
And, yeah, we like to wear clothes, girls still look beautiful
And it covers up our human dick , eat a lot of tuna fish
But these days, it's like we don't know how to act
All these shootings, pollution, we under attack on ourselves
Like, let's all just chill , respect what we built 
Like look at the internet! It's cracking as hell
Fellas, don't you love the cum when you have sex? 
And I heard women orgasms are better than a dick 
So what we got this land for? What we gotta stand for?
Love, and we love the Earth 

Oh, yeah, baby, I love the Earth
I love this planet

Hey, Russia, we're cool
Hey, Asia, all of you, c'mon
Every one of you from the plains to the Sahara
Let's come together and live

Hum-dum-dum-dae-dum, hum-dum-dum-dae-dum

우-우-우리는 지구를 사랑해요

Amamos la tierra

我们爱地球


C'mon everybody, I know we're not all the same
But we're living on the same Earth


Have you ever been to Earth?

Everyone who is listening has been to Earth, Ariana

We're not making music for aliens here

Are we gonna die?

You know what, Bieber? We might die

I'm not going to lie to you
I mean, there's so many people out here who don't believe Global
Warming's a real thing. You know?
We gotta save this planet. We're being stupid

Unless we get our shit together now

Spent a lot of money on my brand new guitar
Baby's got a habit: diamond rings and Fendi sports bras
Ridin' down Rodeo in my Maserati sports car
Got no stress, I've been through all that
I'm like a Marlboro Man so I kick on back
Wish I could roll on back to that old town road
I wanna ride 'til I can't no more

Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta


Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin': Rest in peace to Bon Scott 
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage

Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" 
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend 

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar 
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra 
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" 
They like, Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars? 

I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? 
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack 
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks 
L.A. bitches always askin', Where the coke at? 
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar 

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain't poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
Now I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This shit gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

Niggas been countin' me out
I'm countin' my bullets, I'm loadin' my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin' 'em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

Money in your palm don't make you real
Pistol in your hand don't make you real
Money in your palm don't make you real

Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody

He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go

You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

You better

The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water

His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada

So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment

You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher

Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go

I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better

Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

Hey Nate, how's life?
I don't know it's alright
I've been dealin' with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night

I'm sorry
That's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides

Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin me I'm lost gettin too loud
Had to see a therapist then I found out
Somethin' funny's going on up in my house

Yeah started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know pack my cart take a new route
Clean up my yard get the noose out
Hang up my heart let it air out

I've been searchin'
What does that mean, Nate? I've been learnin'
Grabbin' my keepsakes
Leavin' my burdens
Well I brought a few with me I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey but hey!

It's worth it though
Cold world out there kids grab your coats
Been a minute I know now I'm back to roam
Looking for the antidote
To crack the code
Pretty vivid I admit it I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me I'mma have to crack your nose
For crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope
You seen it?

Been makin a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces
Yeah

That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup
And drown in self-hatred forget what I'm sayin an …

Where the beat go?
Ohh
Ain't that somethin'
Drums came in you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head can't tell me nothin'
Gotta taste of the fame had to pump my stomach

Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face clean off my vomit
OCD tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it
Now y'all done it

I can be critical
Never typical
Intricate with every syllable
I'm a criminal
Intimate but never political
Pretty visual
Even if you hate it I make you feel like you're in it though

You call me what you wanna but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought I could never swim in the kiddy pool
Way that I be thinkin' is cinematic it's beautiful
Man I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos 

The sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See we've all got somethin' that we've trapped inside
That we try to suffocate you know hoping it dies
Try to hold it under water
But it always survives
Then it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that, must not be as crazy I am

The point I'm makin is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me this will only take a moment okay

Just think about it for a second if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great
Not because you're not but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith


I been developin'
Take a look at the benefits
Nothin to meddle with
I could never be delicate
Am I even relevant
That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement
Then bag it up and give me the evidence

Pretty evident
Dependable
Can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman
Depending on if I think your genuine
Pretty elegant
But not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette
I keep it to myself when I celebrate

It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on yeah strap 'em in
Look at me everybody I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me tone that down, but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound better raise your fist
The search begins
I'm back so enjoy the trip

My drip is a talent
Saving is boring
So I might go Harrods
Too many sirens had to skirt off in foreign
Weed got me paranoid
Every time I cut a check i do the OT Bop
Came a long way from them OT shots
Now we doing shows in all these spots
And my young boys still in all these OD spots

Out here early in the year
Trying to be the hustler of the year
Was quay quay quay far there
You see me here, tomorrow there
I was OT Bopping
Trying to get my spot popping

I was meant to go uni
Sold drugs
Got bagged, oh fuck
OT Bop
Now I'm getting bookings, go in' up
Hit the M way, Get gwap
Mummy said leave those streets alone
Try a 9-5, they ain't give me a role
Oh well, I'm on a roll
OT Bop or we go

OT what? OT bop
Take that bag, make him hold this grub
Running to the plug, tryna double this stuff
Now I'm dodging all the cops cause of this stuff
Tracksuit drop with the elegant kicks
Might need prayer for this devilish drip
That girl there she want to take pics
Please don't go ta say cheese

Out here early in the year
Trying to be the hustler of the year
Was quay quay quay far there
You see me here, tomorrow there
I was OT Bopping
Trying to get my spot popping

Making this cash I can never get stopped
Money get low I'm ma OT bop
Never going back got to get this gwap
You know it goes down every time we in the block
Making this cash I can never get stopped
Money get low I'm ma OT bop
Never going back got to get this gwap
You know it goes down every time we in the block

She's 5 out of 10, tell her never mind
9 out of 10 we in top comment
Could a been a off-white but I'm in Vetements
Fuck how you feel that's my sentiments
OT Bop, OT what
Feds chasing the gang, I OT Bopped
I can't really talk right now
Cause the feds got my broski locked

Ever since they born me, cash is the motto
Used to trap in the polo
Now the diamonds flash, take a photo

Gassed in the dance
She's got a arse and a full up bra
Majestic stance and now I pull up, fantastic

Out here early in the year
Trying to be the hustler of the year
Was quay, quay, quay far there
You see me here
Tomorrow there
I was OT Bopping
Trying to get my spot popping
Shit

Yeah, It's been a ride...
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there

You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take this thing out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'm let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say 'em or do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if a thing's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shit'n
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shit's his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was "ehhhh"
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground

Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still tryna figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follow's me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now!

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, Imma face my demons
I'm manning up, Imma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realise what you did, believe me you
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and

I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel that you've been down the same road

If your ass a broke nigga, hell nah, I can't meet ya
If your ass a rich nigga, I'ma fuck ya 'til you ain't one
If that nigga a scammer, I'm turning into a dancer 
I make it clap like he got the right answer
Sit on it with menace, get it harder than a hammer
He wanna freak, pussy pink, breast cancer
Oh, you like dick, just like I like big butts
I don't care about your chain, nigga, or your big truck
Yeah, I know you gettin' it, but is you spendin' it?
Give a fuck what a nigga got if he ain't givin' it
B-badass bitch, bad attitude 
Nails done, hair done, ass too 
Your baby daddy fuckin' me and suckin' me
He don't answer you, bitch, that's because of me 

Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Act up, you can get snatched up
Dirty ass nails, baby girl, you need to back up

I know you so well, so well
I mean, I can do anything that he can
I've been pretty

I know you're somewhere, somewhere
I been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on
I don't wanna pretend we're somethin', we're nothin'
I've been stuck thinkin' 'bout her, I can't hold on

I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain
I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change
Suicidal, same time I'm tame
Picture this, in bed, get a phone call
Girl, that you fucked with killed herself
That was this summer and nobody helped
And ever since then, man, I hate myself
I Wanna fuckin' end it
Pessimistic
Always wanna see me with no pot to piss in
But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'
Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions
Fuckin' sickenin'
At the same time
Memories surface through the grapevine
'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot
Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up
Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up

I'll be feelin' pain
I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same
I'm so numb
I'll be feelin' pain
I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb

I know you so well—I know you, girl
I mean, I can do anything he can
I've been pretty
I know you so well

For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon, I'm getting my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
At the top floor they gone come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question they asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreacting
Like them black kids in Chiraq bitch

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go 
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control 
But there's nowhere to go 
And there's no way to slow 

If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is that goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room, bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doing shit
Them niggas ain't doing shit

Come on homie what happened
You niggas ain't breathing you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready-ready for action

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300 like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby, we living in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

So follow me up cause this shit 'bout to go 
I'm doing 500, I'm outta control 
But there's nowhere to go 
And there's no way to slow 

If I knew what I knew in the past
I would've been blacked out on your ass

God!
God!
God!

We're gonna skate to one song and one song only.

So I ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
first niggas gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a muhfucka like me
Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard, this shit crazy
Y'all don't know that don't shit phase me
The Nets could go 0-82 and I look at you like this shit gravy
Ball so hard, this shit weird
We ain't even supposed to be here
Ball so hard, since we here
It's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael
Take your pick, Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard, got a broke clock, Rolleys that don't tick tock
Audemars that's losing time, hidden behind all these big rocks
Ball so hard, I'm shocked too
I'm supposed to be locked up too
you escaped what I've escaped
You'd be in Paris getting fucked up too
Ball so hard, let's get faded, Le Meurice for like 6 days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin' Ace on my sick J's
So ball so hard, bitch behave, just might let you meet Ye

Chi towns D. Rose, I'm movin' the Nets to BK
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me
That shit cray, that shit cray, that shit cray
She said Ye can we get married at the mall?
I said look you need to crawl ‘fore you ball
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
Ball so hard
That shit cray , ain't it Jay?
Ball so hard
What she order , fish filet
Ball so hard
Your whip so cold , this old thing
Ball so hard
Act like you'll never be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab her hand
Fuck that bitch she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France 
Prince William's ain't do it right if you ask me
Cause I was him I would have married Kate & Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga?
What's Louis my killa?
What's drugs my deala?
What's that jacket, Margiela?

Doctors say I'm the illest
Cause I'm suffering from realness
Got my niggas in Paris
And they going gorillas, huh!

I don't even know what that means.


No, it's not, it's gross

Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

Ball so hard muhfuckas wanna fine me

You are now watching the throne
Don't let me get in my zone x3 These other niggas is lyin'
Actin' like the summer ain't mine
I got that hot bitch in my home
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone x4 The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling
I know I'm bout to kill it
How you know, I got that feeling
You are now watching the throne
Don't let me into my zone x2 I'm definitely in my zone

Author: Belly feat. The Weeknd

Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll back but
All I wanna do is forget about my past and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back but
Imma let it slide ‘cause my niggas too violent
Shoutout to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on the eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone when the shit's too strong
The night's too long

I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not

Bitches know, told a ho, "It's different strokes for different folks"
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the four-one to pacific coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishin' boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke

I know all you bitches want is dick and dough 
Told her, "You don't gotta make it difficult"
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes Christian
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired
Why the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong
The night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it
I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not

We don't need stripes 'cause we got bright stars
We gon' still fight  for that race car 
When you do right , that's 'cause you work hard

Tryna save the whole world, but it ain't my job 
No, it ain't my job

President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter

President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pocket pissin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Told tools like mechanics, mechanism
Uh, Detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu

I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no mother fucker harder than 
I President Carter Pres President Carter

President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter
President Carter Pres President Carter

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died

Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives

When shit get deep I'm never afraid to die
Let the money pile up and tell 'em buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell

Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses
I president carter Pres  President
President Carter Pres President Carter so now
President Carter instead of pledge
we pray President Carter
Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Realitys a bitch and I'm a dance with her

140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech
Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth hahahaha
thank you thank you all
i am president carter

Shut down shows, don't need a bring in

Kwass man's head, split your bored face
Step with .38 or a 12 gauge
They see Russ and everyone panic
Don't want gyal that's bait like Balplanet
On sight ting, I'm done with these faggots
Can't shed light, the ending is tragic
Don't act dumb, you know that Russ did it

Slip over there, make mess, and I come back fine

Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside

Guess who's back
Back again
Shady's back
Tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give you
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty, without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Little Hellions, kids feelin' rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, bitch!
A visionary, vision of scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass
You asked for me?
Well I'm back
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in, endin' up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said, "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me
A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit
Chris Kirk Patrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listen to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty, without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

I said "This looks like a job for me"
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little, controversy
'Cause it feels so empty, without me

Kids!

Huh? Fly 

I drink 'til I'm drunk , smoke til I'm high 
Castle on the hill , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly 
The ladies love the luxury ,
That's why they all fuck with me 
Out here with the moves  like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly

Huh, huh, huh
I stay fresh as hell, take a pic, I might as well, hell
Drop the top and take a selfie, my car drives itself
I got white girls blushin', homie, college girls rushin' on me 
All my diamonds custom so they clutchin' and they touchin' on me

Ooh, pack his vegetables
Ooh, pack his edible
Ooh, it's incredible
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I smell like Bond Number 9, nine
Section full of foreign dimes
Bitch is starin' at me sayin', "Wow"
Unforgettable like Nat King Cole
Gucci berry wine, don't sneak and tell your ho 
Her one night show, a human bank roll 
She lost in the sauce 'cause Gucci got the glow 

I drink 'til I'm drunk , smoke 'til I'm high 
Castle on the hill , wake up in the sky 
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly 
The ladies love  luxury, that's why they all fuck with me
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly , I know I'm super fly 

Now watch me fly, fly
Now watch me fly, fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly

Mine so fly, don't need no flight attendant
Big Cuban link, don't need no pendant
I ain't never had no pot to piss in, yeah
Now all my records trendin'
Oh my, I came from stealing bikes to flying on a G5
I don't know why I been smokin' this Cherry Pie so much
But this my life
I'm on adderall, I be smellin' Hi-Tec when I piss

Like it's basketball, I drop 50-pointer on my wrist
It's Lil Kodak, take a pic
I came home to drop the heat
All these diamonds got me sick, I'm actin' spoiled
Cutlass sittin' high, I feel like I can fly
So fresh to death it's crazy, feel like I can die
I done finally got my wings, they make me wanna sing 

I drink 'til I'm drunk ,
Smoke 'til I'm high 
Castle on the hill , wake up in the sky
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly ,
I know I'm super fly 
The ladies love luxury, that's why they all fuck with me 
Out here with the moves like I invented smooth 
You can't tell me I ain't fly 
I know I'm super fly ,
I know I'm super fly 

Now, now watch me fly, fly
Now watch me fly, fly
You can't tell me I ain't fly
I know I'm super fly, I know I'm super fly...

Author: Ed Sheeran

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to Cèilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost

And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone

How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

When I see you again
See you again, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I see you again

Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!

Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's...
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 

The soul's escaping
Through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring
But superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows he's grown farther
From home, he's known father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner, but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da da da

You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go 
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 

No more games, I'm a change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the...
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder trying to feed and water my seed plus
Teeter totter, caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot
Another day of monotony has gotten me
To the point, I'm like a snail, I've got to formulate a plot
Or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option
Failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go 
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go 
You only get one shot
Do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo 
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

One more try
We have come  too far to stop, now
Yeah, Dilla
One more try
It is all that we have now

Two DJ's, one microphone
We freestyle, we write at home
It don't, it don't, uh, uh, we go on
You the one, I can't leave alone

You grown, I know you grown
When I'm in you, I feel at home
We in the house of love, no lie
Appreciate you more, as time goes by

When it's truly true, it don't die
I see you in L.A., I see you in NY
I see you in the A, I see you in the Chi
I hear you when Jay still make the song cry

Truthfully I wanna rhyme like common sense
You the one, that gave me that confidence
You the one, that told me 'bout consciousness
And stressed seeing beyond, my metropolis

You put the booga booga loop, pop lock in this
We too far, ain't no stoppin' this

Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are

Here, here, here, here, here, here, here we go
They say that, that love makes you grow
You've been sense-sense-sensational
Instrume-eentational

In my life, you've been vocal
But at times, I felt like I didn't know you
Now I know, you had to grow too
And experience life so you can know you

We all change, for what it's worth
You an angel and still down to Earth
In many ways you like my religion
When no one else did, to me you'd listen

Gangstas, Gods, you hugged and kiss 'em
No matter you stayed in my system
Your eyes glisten, you talk vision of partyin'
And gettin' people out of prison
Through the struggle you taught us to Nipsey Hussle
That's why we all love you

Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are

You gave me a voice in the world
It's been hard to choose another girl
They trip when you mumble, they trip when you sing
But you gave us, a chance to dream

In young thugs, you see a future
You recognize little Uzi ain't here to shoot ya
At 21, you knew I was savage
But you said "Common you will never be average"

It's a Cole World, we need Jay
If you can dot com, you can dot K
You rock 2 Chainz, keep your mind free
You see a Malcolm X in a YG

You told me I'm the Mane like Gucci
With a chance to rap and make movies
You gave Mills to the Meek, to inherit the Earth
Before me too, you said "Ladies first"

Things get Rocky, you there A$AP
Rocky or Ferg, you there to swerve
I want you to get the love you deserve
My will made it on a mic' with words

With noname I was hard MC
Love and Hip-Hop, on some Cardi B
Now you a part of me, creating Tyler style
A Future ain't odd to see

Free spirit, with young will like Jaden
When I see you, you never agin'
Made in America, for the world to see
You're everybody but you my girl to me

I'm forever yours, to the tic-toc
I'm still talking 'bout you, Hip-Hop

Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are
Who knew? Who knew that we would take it this far?
I, I love you so just be who you are

Uh-uh, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, we keep, uh
We keep, yeah, uh-uh, we keep
Yeah, keep, uh, we-we keep, uh

We, uh, k-k-keep, uh
We, k-k-keep, uh
We, k-k-keep
I-I k-k-keep it on

K-k-k-keep it on
Yo, let's, let's, let's go up
Yeah, we-we go up, yeah
Let's, let's, let's go up, woah

We-we-we go up, yeah

We-we-we go up, yeah
Let's, let's, let's go up, uh

I can hold my liquor
But this man can't handle his weed
Dark and lonely now
On Chicago, south of town
I'm on to Indiana
I heard it in the radio now

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me
I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga

But you really just know the old me

Bitch I'm back out my coma
Waking up on your sofa
When I park my Range Rover
Slightly scratch your corolla
Okay, I smashed your corolla
I'm hanging on a hangover
Five years we been over
Ask me why I came over
One more hit and I can own ya
One more fuck and I can own ya
One cold night in October
Pussy had me floating
Feel like Deepak Chopra
Pussy had me dead
Might call 2Pac over
Yeezy's all on your sofa
These them Red Octobers
Still ain't learn me no manners
You love me when I ain't sober
You love me when I'm hungover
Even when I blow doja
Then her auntie came over
Skinny bitch with no shoulders
Tellin' you that I'm bogus
Bitch you don't even know us
"Baby girl, he's a loner
Baby girl, he's a loner
Late night organ donor
After that he disown ya
After that he's just hopeless
Soul mates become soulless

When it's over it's over"
And bitch, I'm back out my coma

Callin' up your uncle's place

Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh I wanna phone home

I can't handle no liquor
But these bitches can't handle me

I can't control my niggas
And my niggas they can't control me
You say you know me, my nigga
But you really just know the old me

I heard you need a new fad 
I heard you need a new stack 
I heard you need a new phone 
I know your 'rents ain't be home 
Callin' up your uncle's place
Shit's all over the place
I don't hear your phone
Ohhh I wanna phone home

I think I just fell in love with a porn star
Turn the camera on, she a born star
Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners do the CPR
She gave that old nigga a ulcer
Her bitter sweet taste made his gold teeth fake, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what!
We headin' to hell for heaven's sake, Huh!
Well I'mma levitate, make the devil wait, Yeah!

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

Never in your wildest dreams, never in your wildest dreams
In your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams, comin' from inside the screen
You a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well I guess a lotta niggas do gang bang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves all on a chain gang
Bang bang bang bang bang

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

One day I'm gon' marry a porn star
We'll have a big ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bride's maid
She wanna role play, 'til I roll over
I'mma need a whole day, at least rolled doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day
'Specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, "Get away."
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby we'll live a hell of a life

I think I fell in love with a porn star
And got married in a bathroom
Honeymoon on the dance floor
And got divorced by the end of the night
That's one hell of a life

Yellow model shit, yellow bottle sipping
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missing
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupee

If you get what I get, what would you say?

Look at me now, look at me now

'Cause I'm killing every nigga that try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick

Oops, I said on my dick
I ain't really mean to say on my dick
But since we talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it, I'm done
Ayo Breezy

Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling
When you're doing that thing over there, homie
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye
Let's go

'Cause I feel like I'm running and I'm feeling like I gotta

Get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop 'cause

You know I gotta win everyday day, go
She didn't really wanna pop me
Just know that you will never flop me
And I know that I can be a little cocky, no

You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come a nigga gotta set it, then I got it go and then I get it
Then I gotta blow it and then I gotta shred it
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doing

'Cause it doesn't matter 'cause I'm gonna dada dada
Then I'm gonna murder every thing and anything
A bada boom a bada bing, I gotta do a lot of things
And make it clearer to a couple niggas that I always win

And I gotta get it again and again and again
And I be doing it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
Everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the the best

When I come to doing this and I'm banging on my chest
And I bang in the east and I bang in the west
And I come to give you more and I never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you can read it in the press

Do you really wanna know what's next? Let's go
See the way we all in it, we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, now try to keep up with the pace
And we struggling and hustling, I said it and I get it

And always gotta do her take her to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through his traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne

I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no I'm pollution, no substitution

Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater, got money on my radar
Dress like a skater, got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eating, fuck it, tell a waiter

Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit then I'm like ole!
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind, from the bottom I climb
You ain't hotter at mine, nope
Not on my time and I'm not even trying
What's popping Slime? Nothing five
And if they tripping, fuck 'em five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas, they sweet as pumpkin pie
Ciroc and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch I'm enticing, guiding light
And my pockets white and my diamonds white
And my mommas nice and my daddy's dead
You fagots scared 'cause I'm too wild, been here for a while
I was like fuck trial

Like a preschooler in my garage playing switcharoo
I park the red one, put the yellow in front of the blue
I had the county blues, now every day I'm counting the blues
No lean and Mountain Dews, Guwop I'm so proud of you
Accountants count it, two stacks so tall got a mountain view
My house so big, this bitch mistook it for the Fountain Bleu 
First time I copped the Deuce, said,
"Guwop, I'm so proud of you" 
Guwop's the Trap God and they quote me more than Dr. Seuss 

I'm way richer than when I got out
three years ago 
I freestyle don't even write,
don't even think no more 
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more 
You ain't my friend, you ain't my rider, man, we can't link no more

Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more 
Fresh out parole, and I can't go back to the clink no more 
I had the county blues, now every day,
I'm countin' the blues 
No lean in Mountain Dews, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" 


New clothing line call it Delantic 
My pinky ring sunk the Titanic 
She say I'm fine, she threw her panties 
The coldest nigga on the planet 
Coupe dropped the top, I call her Janet 
Them boys fell off, it's like they vanished 
Extendo tucked, this bitch gigantic 
I upped the strap, them niggas panic 

I'm way richer than when I got out
three years ago 
I freestyle don't even write,
don't even think no more 
Put the lean down, I don't want it, I don't drink no more 
You ain't my friend, you ain't my rider, man, we can't link no more

Ran out of places to tattoo, can't get no ink no more 
Fresh out parole, and I can't go back to the clip no more 
I had the county blues, now every day,
I'm countin' the blues 
No lean in Mountain Dews, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you" 


"Gu-Guwop I'm so proud of you" 
No lean in Mountain Dews, "Guwop, I'm so proud of you"

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
When the world gives you a raw deal
Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in
Manevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
And I know they're gonna hate
But I don't care, I barely can wait
To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
Because they're gonna taste my—

Venom,  adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

Venom,  adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em


I said knock knock, let the devil in
Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
It-it's evident I'm not done
V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
Like a web and you just caught in 'em
Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
Beat strangler attack
So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi 
Translation, I will probably kill us both
When I end up backin' into ya
You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
When you're bit with the—

Venom, adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

Venom,  adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em


I said knock knock, let the devil in
Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
Ain't no telling when this chokehold
On this game will end, I'm loco
Became a Symbiote, so
My fangs are in your throat, ho
You're snake-bitten with my—venom
With the ballpoint pen I'm
Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
Chased it with straight liquor
Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Venom,  adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

Venom,  adrenaline momentum
And I'm not knowin' when I'm
Ever gonna slow up and I'm
Ready to snap any moment I'm
Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
They ain't gonna know what hit 'em

You used to call me on my
You used to, you used to
Yeah

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
You and me, we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages in your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone
Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
You was in the zone, yeah
You should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

Ever since I left the city...

Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane
Gucci Mane, Gucci Mane, Gucc'  

Wizop there, Wizop there, Wizop there
Wizop there, Wizop there 

Gucci there, Gucci there, Gucci there
Gucci, Guwop, oh that Gucc'  


God keep coverin' me with drip, I think He tryna smother me
They stopped me at the border, had too many felonies
I'm splashin', I ain't even drippin'
Laughin', I ain't even trippin'
I'm crashin', I ain't even dissin'
Heard he dropped somethin', I ain't even listen

No one realer, triller, street gorilla
I pull up like Chauncey Billups
Nigga, don't gas me, I don't need a fill-up
Took her up and make her suck my dick till she hiccup
Wild nigga slim like a bicycle rim
But his bank obese and the pockets on chubby

Hit up like head-cold just like Lovett
Thuggin' in public, these hoes love it
I double and triple, quadruple your budget
Baseball money like David Justice
Whole load sold, I ain't even touched it
Underarm kush, damn, the room so musty

Most of you rappers all style, no substance
Big ol' rocks on, they disgust me
Niggas talk but never touch me
Broke haters can't tell me nothin'


Yeah, this that Meek Mill 'n' Gucci Mane
Young nigga swim through F and N's
They gon' come right back through, like a boomerang
Louis and Saint Laurent drip, ooh
Pimp on these bitches like Pootie Tang
He wanna be by that bitch but we all fuckin' her
So he don't know who to blame

She want a check from me, huh
She gotta check for me, huh
Fuckin' the two baddest bitches on Instagram
They on the ecstasy, hey
Diamonds like Voss, and I got the sauce
I mix up the recipe
Before all this rappin' shit, I was a trapper
The plug gon' invest in me

Woah, jumped off the porch
I got a Porsche, too many hitters
They can't extort, I take that meal to the table, no fork
Then split it up with my dogs like divorce
They shot at us, it was by force
We shot at them, they went to court

I don't wan' beef with these niggas no more
I cannot beef with these niggas no more
Shorty says she only fuck trappers
Ended up fuckin' with a rapper
Damn, bitch, how you go backwards?

Diamonds all froze like Alaska 
That ain't even none of my business
Put your face down and your ass up
I ain't preachin' to you like the pastor
I'ma keep runnin' these bands up, yeah

Bands up, bands up, bands up, bands up
Bands up, bands up, bands up, bands up
All these diamonds on me make me handsome
Shorty fuckin' on me like a dancer

Bands up, bands up, bands up, bands up
Bands up, bands up, bands up, bands up
Went from a trapper to a rapper
Damn, bitch, how you go backwards?

Wow, I thought I was proud of you
But I take it back
You wouldn't understand 
When you out with a stack

Or are you tired of that
Where these shooters at
Thought you had a plug
Yeah I had a scrub
Damn

Poppin' pills is all we know

Don't go through the front door 
It's lowkey at the night show
So don't you open up that window
Don't you let out that antidote
Party on a Sunday 
Do it all again on Monday 
Spent a check on a weekend 
I might do it all again 
I just hit a three peat
Fucked three hoes I met this week 
I don't do no old hoes 
My nigga, that's a no-no 
She just want the coco 
I just want dinero
Who that at the front door?
If it's the feds, oh-no-no-no 
Don't you open up that window

Poppin' pills is all we know

Lord I'm on fire they think that I'm Satan
Callin' me crazy on different occasions
Kickin' the cameraman off of my stages
Cause I don't like how he snappin' my angles
I'm overboard and I'm over-impatient
Over my niggas and these kids my ages
Dealin' with Mo' shit that's more complicated
Like these two bitches that might be related
H-Town, you got one and you Bun B like a number one
It's late night, got a late show
If you wanna roll, I got a place where...
Poppin' pills is all we know
In the hills is all we know 
Don't go through the front door 
It's lowkey at the night show
So don't you open up that window

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone, public excuse me
Been wanting my cake, I need it too, wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated
When I blew seep it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Ooh, hit the lottery, oh wee
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet
It was like winning a huge meet
Ironic 'cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep, one sheep, two sheep

Going cucko and cuckier as Kool Keith

But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing

Well, that's nothing
Now I ain't much of a poet, but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment
And don't squander it, 'cause you never know when it could all be over
Tomorrow so I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, ponder it, Do you wonder there's no wonder you're losing your mind the way
you're brought up?)
I think you've been wandering off down yonder and stumbled upon Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I needed an intervention in this to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very things that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking

I'm just relaying what the voice of my head saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath

And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing
Well, that's nothing
Call me crazy, but I had this vision

One day that I'd walk amongst you regular civilians
But until then drums get killed I'm coming straight at
MCs, blood get spilled and I take it back
To the days that I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played at
Pumped the villian and shit that say back
To the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million

Who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Straw in the gold chump I will spend Rumpelstiltskin in a hay stack
Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts

I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You trying to save me, stop holding your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothing

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch
And the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I, I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day
For the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life, we were runnin' out of time

Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you

This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer
All the stars are closer

Split and go where
Back to wearin' knockoffs, haha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Hoes like vultures, wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty hoes in a baller-nigga matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, and tasteless, P

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me
I guess you've got an advantage
'Cause you could blame me for everything
And I don't know how I'm a manage
If one day you just up and leave

Junior do you like it when I cry? 
Do you consider my feelings when you lie 
You put me second to some bitch on the side 
You just gon’ let a ride or die die inside 
You forget I was with you before the racks came
Before these skanks came
Before the plaques came
Before you started getting money and your raps changed
I was with you when you was still thinking about changing your rap name, nigga!
Say something now
Are you choking?
Baby I’m sorry
Are you joking?
So much for convincing me to be open
I don’t know why I bother with you
When you’ve clearly chosen, this music over me
It owns all your emotions
And you really have to give it your undivided devotions
But somehow my heart feels safer when you hold it
Like you not the one that broke it

End up falling for you

Into the dark I followed you but

You call too late or too early
I couldn’t talk I was grumpy
You couldn’t talk you was grumpy?
We supposed to be
Junior you told a hoe you don’t love me
She posted about it you dummy
All I ever did was love you
I don’t deserve to be punished
I cut off all my friends for you
What more do you want from me
You cheated too
That was too long ago
One of my dudes
We made it long ago
That makes it cool?
I said I’m sorry though
What the fuck y’all doing all along 
'Guess I’ve always been a dummy
Bitch I dare you to lie to me to say you told him you love me
And you know what
I should’ve known you were hiding something
You laughed at everything he said
That nigga wasn’t even funny
You made me feel so insecure and weak as fuck
But I’m not sending you away
So you going to have to run for me
'Cause I still love you

End up falling for you
I find myself calling for you
Into the dark I followed you but

So I ease your roll for just a bit, uh
Buy your drink, you have a sip, uh

You grabbin' me close and closer 'til you get a kiss
Push up your bra to the left, that's right
Now we in a car with a broke brake light
Thinking 'bout the ass, the lake, the heat, the sex
The whip, the finger falling, why didn't we dip out?

You say  y'wanna  party all day
You say you needed lovin' from me
You say y'wanna , party , all day 
You say you needed 
So why waste time? 
So why waste time? 
So why waste time? 
Why waste time? 

Ayo
Your boyfriend pissed off
Smackin' his lips off
The fact my lips are covered in your lip gloss
I say we should dip off out of here
Talk, speak, share some words, grab a ear
Nah, you can't take off, unless you leave your amigo
Swallow your pride and put aside your ego
Man, fuck bein' modest, I'm just bein' honest
You seem home-cooked and them buns McDonald's
But , now, the bid is off 
Niggas always dip and they duck the sauce 
Rocks on my neck, I don't know the cost 
Car out front like the Uber, Uber 
We can hop in, and you can top ten
The list that I wanted to hop in 
List is full, so I'ma call it a night 
And you ain't even my type
I'm all bark, no bite, I'm so sorry 
Wasted time, I wasted time
Why you dutty wine, it's whatever 
You sweatin' drips upon my sweater 
It's hot in here, the outside's better 
I'm leavin', leavin', you call me back, it's like emotions recedin'
Let's call it an evening, it's gettin' desperate, yeah

So why waste time?
You say y'wanna party all day
You say you needed lovin' from me

Mustard on the beat, ho

I'm in the dark goin' brazy
I'm in the dark throwin' twenty past eighty
I'm in the dark, it's a movie, Scorsese
I'm in the dark, that's how life been lately
In the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

I'm in the dark goin' brazy 
I'm in the dark tryna make a baby 
I'm in the dark like, "Fuck you, pay me" 
I need my hundreds dark blue like the Yankees
Slowly  losin' my focus 
Need a bitch in a Benz, not a Ford Focus 
I'm in the dark, I don't trust you, I'm totin' 
YG on bullshit, you already knowin' 
My life dark 
The Lamborghini red, but it's dark 
I drive mines in the dark, you leave it parked 
Trust issues, I done had 'em since the start 
I'm in the field with piranhas and the sharks 
I get a lot of love but it's dark
The freaks come out at night
The freaks come out at night when it's dark

I'm in the dark goin' brazy
I'm in the dark throwin' twenty past eighty
I'm in the dark, it's a movie, Scorsese
I'm in the dark, that's how life been lately
In the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

I like my bitches dark 
I hit 'em at the park when it's dark 
I hit my target like a dart 
YG go dumb, but he's smart 
In real life, you a mark 
Disrespect me, I'm on your head, I'm a scarf 
Told my barber cut my hair, leave a part 
But don't line me up in the dark 
My life dark, but I see the truth 
Pop up on your bitch like peek-a-boo 
I'm in a coupe, I don't need the roof 
Her ass really shock me like Pikachu 
 I do a bitch harsh 
Break her heart to a thousand parts
They like, "How this ghetto nigga on the charts?"
Face down, ass up, back gotta be arched

I'm in the dark goin' brazy
I'm in the dark throwin' twenty past eighty
I'm in the dark, it's a movie, Scorsese
I'm in the dark, that's how life been lately
In the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark


In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

I'm in the dark goin' brazy
I'm in the dark throwin' twenty past eighty
I'm in the dark, it's a movie, Scorsese
I'm in the dark, that's how life been lately
In the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark, in the dark, in the dark
In the dark

Yeah, hahahahaha

'Cause you know in the old days
They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say
They had to fake orgasms and shit
We can tell niggas today:
"Hey, I wanna cum, mothafucka!"

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 

Your boyfriend is a dork, McLovin 

I just pulled up in a Ghost 
Fucked that bitch up out in London 
Then I fucked up on her cousin
Or her sister, I don't know nothin' 
And my niggas gettin' ignorant
Like a lighter, bitch, we ignant 
All this water on my neck
Look like I fell when I went fishin' 
So much diamonds on my bust down
Ooh, fuck, what's the time? 
Me and Smokepurpp sippin' drank 
Ooh, fuck, she take lines 

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 

You're such a fuckin' ho
When the first time they ask you if you want sparklin' or still?
Why you tryna act like you was drinkin'
sparklin' water 'fore you came out here?
You're such a fuckin' h—

I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck 
I'm a sick fuck, I like a quick fuck
I like my dick sucked, I'll buy you a sick truck
I'll buy you some new tits, I'll get you that nip-tuck
How you start a family? The condom slipped up
I'm a sick fuck, I'm inappropriate
I like hearin' stories, I like that ho shit
I wanna hear mo' shit, I like the ho shit
Send me some mo' shit, you triflin' ho bitch 

You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it 
You're such a fuckin' ho, I love it

They couldn't say the shit they wanted to say

Get money and money, we multitask
Back then used to drive round ends in faulty cars
Look at my face, all these scars, girls still chase, call me Hards
Don't tark too much like Stormzy's darg

Life's improving fast, look at that German, guten Tag
Hollywood, cruising past, now I've got bare man moving sarft
I like ruthless cars, me and my girl do rooftop bars
Cop me a house before I got jewels, uni got a man moving smart

She wanna talk feelings
Meet and greeting, me, I just smashed then leaving
They talk 'bout beefing, diss, diss
Sneaking, niggas get splashed for speaking
White like Peter,
Brown like Cleveland, trap fit, I'll be out all evening
My white ting looking Madonna
I hate it when she leaves makeup on my collar

Me and Dave got matching Mercs, me and Ace got matching hoes
It's there when the mandem trap, Gucci pouches, matching phones
Tings on the go, hotel, doing up snaps, matching robes
Look at these losers
Mans exclusive, me and Neymar got matching clothes

It's like everyting I dig they think they're wifey
And she thinks she's my main but that's my side piece
Still break down Lizz on my scale, do it gentle, nicely
Jump out on sidestreets, see them, I let mine squeeze

Pure cats, no receipts, all black, so discrete
Let a man get pussy in private, let a man get dough in peace
Right now overseas, changed up, noticeably
Got a WAG telling me "come over", dash my balls in her ovaries
Life's improving fast, look at that German, guten Tag 
Life's improving fast, foreign body, excusez moi
Tracksuit when I'm in ends, AMG, mover class
24k, watch that wrist, Hollywood H, Bruno Mars

Might pull up on your bitch,
I'm vain, excuse me miss, can I get a name?
My team, they're ready for stains
Mind he don't grips your neck and chain
Came from dishing out pebs in a Range
Do it on the ends or send it on a train
Man do it so styley, white like Miley, all of them cats dem like me

Uhh, manna old school indeed
Roll in twos or threes, bro them yutes are neeks
Manna so rude indeed, babe, it's not you, it's me
These girls got A-S-S but love A-S-S-U-M-E
Niggas always gon' ask for shit, bitches always gon' ask for dick
Dick long, I'm a narcissist, I can't even put half my tip
Niggas hate, nothing new, middle finger, my parting gift
Balmain, that's a starter kick but I need a Louis Vuitton partnership

Life's improving fast, 4s, still cruising past
G check, see who's in cars, now I got bare man moving sarft
Life's improving fast, look at that German, guten Tag
24k, watch that wrist, Hollywood H, Bruno Mars

It starts with
One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time

All I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away

It's so unreal
It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryna hold on, did-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go

Watch you go
I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard

I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far

Got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end

In the end
You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

So, where are you?
It's been a little while...

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Loving what I'm tasting 
Venom on my tongue
Dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations 
Help my body run
I'm running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Fall out of formation 
I plan my escape
From walls they confined
Rebel red carnation 
Grows while I decay
I'm running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Yeah, I'm running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife
Running for my li-i-i-i-i-ife

Hide you in my coat pocket
Where I kept my rebel red
I felt I was invincible
You wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead
My body lives on lead
The last two lines may read
Incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor
But now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes
I love to hate the fight
And you in my life is like...

Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe slide over me
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
When I leave don't save my seat
I'll be back when it's all complete
The moment is medical, moment is medical
Sippin' on straight chlorine

Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Beat is a chemical, yeah
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Let the vibe, let the vibe
Moment is medical, yeah

I'm so sorry, I forgot you
Let me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of
A weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?
I'm just a chemical
Can you build my house with pieces?

I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose, same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

Used to play pretend, give each other different names, we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face singing "wake up, you need to make money", yeah
Used to play pretend, give each other different names, we would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades
You'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
You'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
You'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget

Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

We don't deal with outsiders very well
They say newcomers have a certain smell
You have trust issues, not to mention
They say they can smell your intentions

You'll never know the freak show sitting next to you
You'll have some weird people sitting next to you
You'll think "How did I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said, please don't forget




All my friends are heathens, take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Please don't make any sudden moves
You don't know the half of the abuse

All my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know 
Please all my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know

Why'd you come? You knew you should have stayed
I tried to warn you just to stay away
And now they're outside ready to bust
It looks like you might be one of us

How can you see into my eyes like open doors?
Leading you down into my core, when I've become so numb
Without a soul
My spirit's sleeping somewhere cold
Until you find it there and lead it back home

 Wake me up inside
 Wake me up inside
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run
 Before I come undone
 Save me from the nothing I've become

Now that I know what I'm without
You can't just leave me
Breathe into me and make me real
Bring me to life

 Wake me up inside
 Wake me up inside
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run
 Before I come undone
 Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life

Bring me to life
Frozen inside, without your touch
Without your love, darling
Only you are the life
Among the dead

All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything!
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul

There must be something more!
Bring me to life!

 Wake me up inside
 Wake me up inside
 Call my name and save me from the dark
 Bid my blood to run
 Before I come undone
 Save me from the nothing I've become

Bring me to life

Bring me to life

No sleep 'til - Brooklyn

Foot on the pedal - never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job's ain't a job - it's a damn good time
City to city - I'm running my rhymes
On location - touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking - your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast - watching all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine to five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden - cold kickin' it live

No sleep 'til -

Another place - another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl - another fight
Another drive all night
Our manager's crazy - he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world - you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel - girls on the jock
We're thrashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor - Adrock's out the door
M.C.A.'s in the back because he's skeezin' with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back

No Sleep 'til

No Sleep 'til Brooklyn

Ain't seen the light since we started this band
M.C.A. - get on the mic my man
Born and bred Brooklyn - U.S.A.
They all me Adam Yauch - but I'm M.C.A.
Like a lemon to a lime - a lime to a lemon
I sip the def ale with all the fly women
Got limos, arena, TV shows
Autograph pictures and classy hos
Step off homes - get out of my way
Taxing little girlies form here to L.A.
Waking up before I get to sleep
Cause I'll be rocking this party eight days a week

No sleep 'til
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn
No sleep 'til Brooklyn

And your look's just the same without no make-up
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of 
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up
You can run inside my life from that fame bus
'Cause I promise when we step out you'll be famous
Modern day Bonnie and Clyde what they named us

Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watching Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though
Plug, plug, plug, I'm the plug for her
She want a nigga that pull her hair and hold the door for her
Baby, that's only me, bitch, it okay with me

Lookin' for the one? Well, bitch, you're looking at the one
I'm the best yet, and yet, my best is yet to come
'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody
Oh my God! She hit me up all day, give no response
Bitch, you blow my high, that's like turning gold to bronze
Roll my eyes
And when she on the molly she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie, but it's more like Whitney Bobby
God, forgive me
Tunechi and finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out The Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula gang winning record, I'm just flexing on my exes, oh God!

Yeah, you're lookin' at the truth, the money never lie no
I'm the one, yeah, I'm the one

These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out
Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back
Talking black, brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants, doo-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just lets his emotions go

Sing with me, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standing on corners and porches just rapping
To having a fortune, no more kissing ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listening to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you

Sing with me, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can

Sing with me, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away

Hey, Macklemore, can we go thrift shopping?

What? What? What? What?

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome.

Walk into the club like "What up? I got a big cock!"
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like "Damn, that's a cold ass honky!"
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this, smells like R. Kelly's sheets 
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch
Imma take your grandpa's style
Imma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? 
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Ah, he got the Velcros!"

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

What you know about rocking a wolf on your noggin?
What you knowing about wearing a fur fox skin?
I'm digging, I'm digging, I'm searching right through that luggage
One man's trash, that's another man's come up
Thank your granddad for donating that plaid button
Up shirt, ‘cause right now, I'm up in here stuntin'
I'm at the Goodwill, you can find me in the 
I'm that, I'm that sucker searching in this section 
Your grammy, your aunty, your momma, your mammy
I'll take those flannel zebra jammies, secondhand and rock that motherfucker
The built-in onesie with the socks on that motherfucker
I hit the party and they stop in that motherfucker
They be like "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!"
I'm like "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit
I call that getting swindled and pimped, shit
I call that getting tricked by a business, that shirt's hella dough
And having the same one as six other people in this club is a hella don't
Peep game, come take a look through my telescope
Trying to get girls from a brand, man, you hella won't
Man, you hella won't



I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

I'll wear your granddad's clothes
I look incredible
I'm in this big ass coat
From that thrift shop down the road

I wear your granddad's clothes 
I look incredible 
I'm in this big ass coat 
From that thrift shop down the road

I'm gonna pop some tags
Only got twenty dollars in my pocket
I'm, I'm, I'm hunting, looking for a come up
This is fucking awesome

Enviyon on the mix

No, no, no, no
No-no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head

I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead

I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Did this shit in the past
But I want it to last
You were made outta plastic 
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak

You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache
You made my heart break again


I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you so I must replace you, oh

Easier said than done
I thought you were the one
Listening to my heart instead of my head
You found another one
But I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Did this shit in the past but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls have the prettiest face?

Easier said than done
I thought you were
Instead of my head, you found another
I won't let you forget me

My hearts a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Gym Class Hero, baby!
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like it read well, check it Travie, I can handle that

Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

If I could only find a note to make you understand
I'd sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep it stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
And know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you

My hearts a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

Let's go!
If I was an old-school fifty pound boombox
Would you hold me on your shoulder, wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops?
And crank it higher everytime they told you to stop
And all I ask is that you dont get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know we come and go like on the interstate

I think I finally found a note to make you understand
If you can hit it, sing along and take me by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head, like your favorite tune
You know my hearts a stereo that only plays for you

My hearts a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

I only pray you'll never leave me behind 
Because good music can be so hard to find 
I take your hand and pull it closer to mine 
Thought love was dead, but now you're changing my mind

My hearts a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo

Oh oh oh oh oh oh to my stereo
Oh oh oh to sing along to my stereo

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?

Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me
I'm reaching out for you?

I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap ineed a new outlet
I know some shit's so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow but I know one fact, I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you have to walk a thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh

I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
Everything is so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature in the room just as soon
As I walk in it's like all eyes on me so I try to avoid any eye contact
'Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention I just want to be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room
Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fucking man servant trying to follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of them ain't even funny like
"Ah! Marshall, you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, god damn!"
Unfortunately I am, but I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down?
Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes
And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you so oh oh

Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We have to take these cards ourselves and flip them, don't expect no help
Now I could have either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in at every single place every school i went
I dreamed of being that cool kid even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna always told me keep makin' that face it'll get stuck like that
Meanwhile I'm just standin' there holdin' my tongue tryna talk like this
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at eight years old
I learned my lesson then cause i wasn't tryna impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
'Cause where you see it from where you're sitting
Is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes, at least
What size you wear? I wear tens let's see if you can fit your feet

In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's mind
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you, so oh oh
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh oh
They can all get fucked just stay true to you, so oh oh

Lately I've been hard to reach
I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world where they can be alone
Are you calling me?
Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me?
I'm reaching out for you?

Yeah
To my babies
Stay strong
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world
God gave you the shoes that fit you
So put 'em on and wear 'em
And be yourself, man
Be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let no one tell you
You ain't beautiful

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

One-night stand, turned to a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...

He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's , my name's 
River , river run
Call me , call me 
River , we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one 
I don't want to admit to something 
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger



Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it


N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
That's how long I been on ya
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger



You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Baby, you're makin' it

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

I can't explain it
I love the pain
And I love the way your breath
Numbs me like novacaine
And we are
Always high
Keep it strange
Okay, yeah, I'm insane
But you the same
Let me paint the picture
Couch by the kitchen
Nothin' but your heels on
Losin' our religion
You're my pretty little vixen
And I'm the voice inside your head
That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
And you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The way we love, is so unique
And when we touch, I'm shivering
And no one has to get it
Just you and me
Cause we're just living
Between the sheets

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Am I out of my head?
Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

You told me yes, you held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down when I kissed that ring

You lost that right to hold that crown
I built you up but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

And you were there, at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up to break it back down
We're building it up to burn it down
We can't wait to burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn
We can't wait to burn it to the ground
When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames as your blazes burn

We can't wait to burn it to the ground

I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I am, a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can
But sometimes I don't make sense
I am, what you never want to say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you
For once just to hear me out
So I, let go watching you turn your back like you always do
You face away and pretend I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

You hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel...
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal...
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug a trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, go, stop the show
Choppy words in a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama, help me I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new Hearse
Can't contain him he knows he works

Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied

So why try ignoring him
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away

I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out

When this began
I had nothing to say
And I get lost in the nothingness inside of me

And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind

But all that they can see the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel

Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own

I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long

I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face


Looking everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind

What do I have but negativity
'Cause I can't justify the way, everyone is looking at me


Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long


I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything till I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long

I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real

I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

somewhere I belong

somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong

Lighting stog after stog, and choke on the smoke
They tell me to quit, don't listen what I'm told
Help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt
I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck, ha, ha, ha
In the cut and I put that on my momma
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either the pussy or the commas

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Push the gas, get a motherfuckin' nose bleed
She ain't never met a youngin' do it like me
She got a man but says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks
'Cause all these hoes know whats about to come next
I hit my plug up, got the paper connect
I drop a couple bands I just wanna go...

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check

Knowing all of this
It just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching
Knowing all of this
It just don't make a difference
I'm just talking shit to the ones that'll listen
I come with the heat man, I swear I'm never missing
And I'm still the same and I swear I'm never switching

Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck

This is fucking awesome

Walk into the club like "What up? I got a big cock!"
Nah, I'm just pumped, bought some shit from a thrift shop
Ice on the fringe is so damn frosty
People like "Damn, that's a cold ass honky!"
Rolling in hella deep, headed to the mezzanine
Dressed in all pink except my gator shoes, those are green
Draped in a leopard mink, girl standing next to me
Probably shoulda washed this
Smells like R. Kelly's sheets 
But shit, it was ninety-nine cents!
Bag it, copping it, washing it, 'bout to go and get some compliments
Passing up on those moccasins someone else been has walking in
Bummy and grudgy, fucking it, I am stunting and flossing and
Saving my money and I'm hella happy, that's a bargain bitch

I'mma take your grandpa's style
I'mma take your grandpa's style
No for real, ask your grandpa
Can I have his hand-me-downs? 
Velour jumpsuit and some house slippers
Dookie brown leather jacket that I found, dig it
They had a broken keyboard, I bought a broken keyboard
I bought a skeet blanket, then I bought a knee board
Hello, hello, my ace man, my Mello
John Wayne ain't got nothing on my fringe game, hell no
I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those
The sneaker heads would be like "Ah, he got the Velcros!"

They be like "Oh that Gucci, that's hella tight!"
I'm like "Yo, that's fifty dollars for a t-shirt!"
Limited edition, let's do some simple addition
Fifty dollars for a t-shirt, that's just some ignorant bitch shit

Author: Ed Sheeran

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou'
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed

The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day

And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows
But my heart will stay the same

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows
My pain, eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain, eraser

In the club lookin' so conspicuous
And rowl! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady I'm a milk the cow
Forget about game I'm a spit the truth
I won't stop till I get 'em in they birthday suits
So gimmie the rhythm and it'll be off with they clothes
Then bend over to the front and touch your toes 
I left the Jag and I took the Rolls
If they ain't cuttin' then I put em on foot patrol
How you like me now?
When my pinky's valued over three hundred thousand
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ursh once more and we leaves 'em dead
We want a lady in the street but a freak in the bed to say

Yeah, yeah
Shawty got down on me and said, come and get me
Yeah, yeah
I got so caught up I forgot she told me
Yeah, yeah
Her and my girl used to be the best of homies
Yeah, yeah
Next thing I knew she was all up on me screaming

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah

Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Usher got the voice make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Ludacris got the flow make ya booty go
Take that and rewind it back
Lil' Jon got the beat make ya booty go

All Around The World
We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
'Cause I'm in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
'Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania

I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
'Bout the mother fucking girls
From California

Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good God girl
I wish I knew ya

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful Around The World
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby
'Cause I'd like to say
I've been Around The World
Back from Bombay

Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase

Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin

Wake up the cake
It's a lake she's kissin' me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily

I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful Around The World
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you wanna go
Who you wanna be
What you wanna do
Just come with me

I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin' in the swiss mountains

Oh me oh my oh
Me and guy ho
Freer than a bird
'Cause were rockin' Ohio

Around The World
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
'Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure
ding ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding ding
I know I know it's you
ding ding dong dong ding ding dong dong ding ding
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
I've been Around The World
And I have seen your love
I know I know it's you
You say hello then I say I do.

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil

I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business

Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody

Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations

Causing grief in human relations

It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces

Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white

What I've got, you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got, you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop continue
Realize, I don't want to be a miser

Confide with sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now

Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
Greedy little people in a sea of distress

Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me say hell yes
I'm a low brow, but I rock a little know how

No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart, get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time, than right now
Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley, taught me how to off it
Bob Marley, walkin' like he talk it

Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it?
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now

Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper

Lucky me, swimmin' in my ability
Dancin' down on life with agility
Come and drink it up, from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility

My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times, when she scrub me
Feelin' good, my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice, young love chug-a-lug me

There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody, time to deliver
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
Give it away, give it away, give it away, now
I can't tell, if I'm a king pin or a pauper
What I've got, you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got, you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water

What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got, you've got to get it put it in you

Realize, I don't want to be a miser

Yeah, yo

You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no
I followed, so taken
So conditioned, I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid, I couldn't let myself see

That I could never be held
Back or up, no, I hold myself
Check the rep, yep, you know mine well
Forget the rest, let them know my hell
There and back, yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up, the best they fell
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there, saying...

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go, go, go

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told no
And I've come back, unshaken
Let down, and lived and let go

So, you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there, saying...

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up, and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how

I don't care where the enemies are
Can't be stopped, all I know, go hard
Won't forget how I got this far
For every time, saying...

In these promises broken, deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So, one last lie I can see through
This time, I finally let you go
Go, go, go, go, go, go

Yeah
Yo
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady, something's empty within'em

We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
‘Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and fear
Until we dead it, forget it, let it all disappear

Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control

Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

 I know what it takes to move on
 I know how it feels to lie
 All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
 Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

 I know what it takes to move on
 I know how it feels to lie
 All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
 Holding on to what I haven't got

Yo, yo
What was left when that fire was gone
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on

And I don't even know what kind of things I've said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead so
Picking up the pieces now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again


All I wanna do is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got



I'm holding on to what I haven't got


Holding on to what I haven't got

You should want a bad bitch like this
Drop it low and pick it up just like this
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, somethin' worth a half a ticket on my wrist
Takin' all the liquor straight, never chase that
Rooftop like we bringin' '88 back
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spillin', you should taste that
I'm so fancy, you already know
I'm in the fast lane from L.A. to Tokyo
I'm so fancy, can't you taste this gold?
Remember my name, 'bout to blow

Can't stand no haters and honest, the truth is
And my flow retarded, they speak it, depart it
Swagger on super, I can't shop at no department
Better get my money on time, if they not money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that they give that line a rewind
So get my money on time, if they not money, decline
I just can't worry 'bout no haters, gotta stay on my grind
Now tell me, who that, who that? That do that, do that?
Put that paper over all, I thought you knew that, knew that

Remember my name, 'bout to blow
Trash the hotel
Let's get drunk on the mini bar
Make the phone call
Feels so good getting what I want
Yeah, keep on turning it up
Chandelier swinging, we don't give a fuck
Film star, yeah I'm deluxe
Classic, expensive, you don't get to touch, ow!
Still stunting, how you love that?
Got the whole world asking how I does that
Hot girl, hands off, don't touch that
Look at that I bet you wishing you could clutch that
That's just the way you like it, huh?
You're so good, he's just wishing he could bite it, huh?
Never turn down money
Slaying these hoes gold trigger on a gun like

I don't mind
Letting you down easy, but just give it time
If it don't hurt now then just wait, just wait a while
You're not the big fish in the pond no more

Ain't it fun
Living in the real world

Well, you can ring anybody's bell and get what you want

I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act for me
You do favors then rapidly
You just turn around and start askin' me about
Things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe some day I'll be just like you
And step on people like you do
And run away all the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous, you should have known
That you'd wear out your welcome and now you see
How quiet it is all alone

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away
You try to take the best of me, go away

I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I wanna be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Shut up... what!
I am so sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
 Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
 Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Now, let's do that song for Peep
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Rain keeps falling, tears keep falling
Darling, your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fine
Oh-oh-oh...

Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around, yeah

His name will live, brother
No, I got—, I feel hella shitty because it's like, yo
Like, if I would have known he was so cool
And it's like, yo, if I would have watched interviews sooner, bro, we were so alike
It's unfortunate because it's like, yo, when people die, that's when we like 'em, you know?
'Cause your remorse kinda makes you check 'em out

Darling, your love is like walking a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fine
Oh-oh-oh...

Come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around, yeah
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down

That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
Hello I was listening to this song
It goes like

I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it


Wish I never ever ever told you things
I was only only trying to show you things
Iced out heart on your neck trying to froze your ring
I had to get a me a new bitch to hold the pain
We was in Hawaii looking at the ring
She smiling happy but I'm laughing 'cause her new man a lame

That just goes to show me money don't attract a thing 
Stuck to the plan even though you used to go with my mans
Oh get over it
 

I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it
I know you're sad and tired
You've got nothing left to give
You'll find another life to live
I know that you'll get over it


I tied up my RAF you strapped up your Rick
Diamonds on your neck, ice all on my wrist
Complement my style
She don't want me I'm running wild
You know I respect her on that level
She don't want me then I'ma let her
Go over there with that broke fella
Walk off my Saint Laurent, that leather
My new chick I swear that she better
Want me back, never 


That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her
 


I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live
I swear that you'll get over it 
I know it hurts sometimes but you'll get over it 
You'll find another life to live 
I know that you'll get over it 


You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
You'll get over it
That's true, that's right
She's sipping Moet, and yeah I swear it gets her wetter
My Louboutins new, so my bottoms, they is redder
No I'm not a rat but I'm all about my cheddar
Just talked to your homie she said we should be together
Gave me brain, was so insane that I made her my header
If she ever call my phone you know I gotta dead her
But I like that girl too much, I wish I never met her

Hey, where's the drum?
Wooo oh
Let's go

Woo girl, you're shinin'
Like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to
You're never goin' out of style

Woo pretty baby
This world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me
When I just wanna make you smile

I wanna thrill ya like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic 

Baby, you're so classic 
Baby you
Baby, you're so classic

Four thousand roses
Anything for you to notice
All the way to serenade you
Doin' it Sinatra style

I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac
Like a gentleman, bringin' glamour back
Keep it real to real in the way I feel
I could walk you down the aisle

I wanna thrill you like Michael
I wanna kiss you like Prince
Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway
Write a song for you like this

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
It's not a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, like it

Out of my league, old school chic
Like a moviestar from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic 
Baby, you're so classic 
Baby, you're so classic

Baby you're class, and baby you're sick
I never met a girl like you until we met
A star in the 40′s, centerfold in the 50′s
You got me trippin' out like the 60′s – hippies
Queen of the discotheque
A 70′s dream with an 80′s vest
Hepburn, Beyoncé, Marilyn, Massive
Girl, you're timeless
Just so classic

You're over my head, I'm out of my mind
Thinkin' I was born in the wrong time
It's not a rewind, everything is so throwback-ish
I kinda like it, like it

Out of my league, old school chic
Like a moviestar from a silver screen
You're one of a kind, livin' in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic 
Baby, you're so classic 
Baby, you're so classic
Ooooo, classic

Me with the floorshow
Kickin' with your torso
Boys getting high
And the girls even more so
Wave your hands if you're not with the man
Can I kick it 
I got 
You got 
We got everybody
I've got the gift
Gonna stick it in the goal
It's time to move your body

Babylon back in business
Can I get a witness
Every girl every man
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't want to rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop, DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Singin' in the classes
Music for your masses
Give no head
No backstage passes
Have a proper giggle
I'll be quite polite
But when I rock the mike
I rock the mike 
You got no love then you're with the wrong man
It's time to move your body
If you can't get a girl but your best friend can
It's time to move your body

I don't want to be sleazy
Baby, just tease me
Got no family planned
Houston, do you hear me?
Ground control, can you feel me?
Need permission to land

I don't want to rock , DJ 
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop , DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't want to rock , DJ 
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop , DJ ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

Pimpin' ain't easy
Most of them fleece me
Every night
Pimpin' ain't easy
But if you're sellin' it 
It's alright

I don't want to rock , DJ 
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop , DJ ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't want to rock , DJ 
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop , DJ ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't want to rock, DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop , DJ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night
I don't want to rock , DJ
But you're making me feel so nice
When's it gonna stop , DJ ?
'Cause you're keepin' me up all night

New York City!
You are now riding, with 50 Cent
You gotta love it

I just wanna chill and twist a lot
Catch suns in my 7-45
You drive me crazy shorty I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need and I
Like your smile I don't wanna see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask and I
Hope you can come up with the answers babe

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century,
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hoopty from a Benz,
Would you poof and disappear like
Some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?
I'd get out and peel a nigga cap and chill and drive
I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flipped burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you feelin' me?
In the bed if I used my tongue would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter would you write back?
Now we can have a lil' drink you know a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Now would you leave me if you're father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm loving?
Are you mad 'cause I'm asking you 21 questions?
Are you my soul mate? 'Cause if so, girl you a blessing
Do you trust me enough, to tell me your dreams?
I'm staring at ya' trying to figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down would you say things to make me smile?
I treat you how you want to be treated just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see?
And when you asked me about it I said "It wasn't me"
Would you believe me? Or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans girl we make mistakes,
To make it up I do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style I say anything to make you smile

Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, It's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me girl?

Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions, and they all about us

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something, fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff, came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers, nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough

Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt

'Cause this is survival of the fittest
This is do or die

This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut, what?
Like I give a fuck but I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt
'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a nut
'Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win, biting the dust, it'll just make me angrier

Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?

This is survival of the fittest

This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue, I'm showing you the flow no one do
'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you

Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then A-chieve

This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all

Can't touch this
Can't touch this
Can't touch this
Can't touch this

My, my, my, my

Music hits me so hard
 makes me say "Oh, my Lord:
Thank you for blessing me
With a mind to rhyme and two hyped feet"

It feels good when you know you're down
A superdope homeboy from the Oaktown
And I'm known as such
And this is a beat, uh, you can't touch

I told you, homeboy:
Can't touch this
Yeah, that's how we livin', and ya know:
Can't touch this

Look in my eyes, man:
Can't touch this
Yo, lemme bust the folk Iyrics
Can't touch this

Fresh new kicks and pants
You got it like that
Now you know you wanna dance
So, move outta your seat
And get a fly girl
And catch this beat
While it's rolling

Hold on
Pump a little bit and let'em know it's going on
Like that
Like that
Cold on a mission, so fall on back
Let'em know that you're too much
And this is a beat, uh, they can't touch

Yo, I told you:
Can't touch this
Why you standing there, man?
Can't touch this
Yo, sound the bell:  school's in, sucker
Can't touch this

"Give me a song or rhythm making no sweat"
That's what I'm giving them, now
They know
They talk about the Hammer
When you're talkin'bout a show
That's hyped and tight

Singers are sweatin'
So pass them a wipe or a tape
To learn
What it's gonna take in the 90's to burn
The chart's legit:
Either work hard or you might as well quit

That's word, because, you know:
Can't touch this
Can't touch this
Break it down!

Stop:  Hammer time!

"Go with the flow", it is said
If you can't groove to this, then you probably are dead
So, wave your hands in the air
Bust a few moves
Run your fingers through your hair

This is it, for a winner:
Dance to this and you're gonna get thinner
Now move, slide your rump
Just for a minute, let's all do the bump


Yeah
Can't touch this
Look, man:
Can't touch this

You'll probably get hyped, boy, 'cause you know you can't
Can't touch this
Ring the bell:  school's back in
Break it down!

Stop:  Hammer time!

Can't touch this
Can't touch this
Can't touch this
Break it down!

Stop:  Hammer time!

Every time you see me
That Hammer's just so hype
I'm dope on the floor
And I'm magic on the mike

Now, why would I ever
Stop doing this
With others making records
That just don't hit?

I toured around the world
From London to The Bay:
It's "Hammer! Go, Hammer! MC Hammer! Yo, Hammer!"
And the rest can go and play
"U Can't Touch This"

Can't touch this
U can't touch this
Yeah
Can't touch this

I told you:
Can't touch this
Too hype, can't touch this
Yo, we're outta here
Can't touch this

America! Ha ha ha! We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars
For the rights that men have died for to protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
For the freedom of speech the United States government has sworn to uphold
Or so we're told


I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'Til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standing in this mirror, bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
'Cause Congress keep telling me I ain't causing nothin' but problems
And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government
I'm loving it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on

White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America! I could be one of your kids
White America! little Eric looks just like this
White America! Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon, baby 
Look at my sales!
Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back
Give me the mic! Show me where the fucking studio's at!
When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like
"Fuck it," until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn, we just swapped: sitting back looking at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is it starting to work to my benefit now?

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!

See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'Til I created so much motherfucking turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too, because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searching with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waiting to choke, tightening around my throat
Watching me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note!"
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy
Sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom
So now I'm catching the flak from these activists when they ragging
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot," shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfucking spokesman now, for

White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!
White America, I could be one of your kids
White America, little Eric looks just like this
White America, Erica loves my shit
I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!


So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer
Aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the ​​flag​​ and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you, Ms. Cheney! Fuck you, Tipper Gore!
Fuck you with the freest of speech this Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have! Fuck you!

Ha ha ha, I'm just playing, America
You know I love you

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I can hear the drummer drumming
And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming
But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit
And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was
Was it, too good to be true?
Have nothin', get it all but too much of it
Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens
Cause if not, where the hell did it go?
Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven
Just choosing to sin
Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again
Do whatever I gotta do just to win
Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head

Crown around it, thorns on it
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?

How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog
But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at

I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate
But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt

Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count
Only time I ever been out and about

Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt
Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter

Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up

Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin'
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong

Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone?
Cause someone told me that



Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir

You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep

Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration
Obliterate anyone in the way

I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me

But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire
Tell these new artists that kings never die

Did it just say I've been upstaged?
Why am I online? It's driving me crazy
I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge
On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform

But as days pass in this shit
And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say
If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous
Comeback as if I went away
But detractors just say so much for the Renegade

Someone's gonna make me blow my composure
Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage
They so want a champion to fall
It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all?
So fuck what these cynics say

 just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall
And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta
With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office
On the floor stacked against the door

Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?

Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards
And trophies just don't mean jack anymore
If I'm here today and gone tomorrow
And I'm not gonna be

Here to stay

Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes

Through the passage of time
Kings never die

I want it, I'm comin' to get it
So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd
Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked
And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne

Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed
Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone
And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving
Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that
Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause

They say kings never die
Just ask Jam Master Jay
They just grow wings and they fly
So, hands up, reach for the sky
Try to hold and prolong these moments
Cause in a blink of an eye
They'll be over

Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur
And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were
So before you're leavin' this Earth
You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk
Deacon of words, syllable genius at work
Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness
I went from powdered milk and Farina
To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts
From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers
I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is
Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is
Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is
It's that "Sound Bombing" Thirstin' Howl
Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz
Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone
God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down
I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground
You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't

Here to stay
Even when I'm gone
When I close my eyes
Through the passage of time
Kings never die

Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You can not catch me, can not hold me
You can not stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

'Cause I know what its like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it so long

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A King can only rein 'till instead
There comes that day, it's off with his head

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes

Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes

And I told them; nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You can not catch me, can not hold me
You can not stop, much less control me

When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes

So much hate at the top, it's a lonely place
When you find out the opps ain't the only snakes
And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down, Stoney, aye
Crash and come back with a swollen face
And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize, sipping on that Koshi, 'Ye, ay
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in 'Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
Your dolphins are dazed, you calling away
'Cause coffins is laid, under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwing rocks at your grave
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it
All the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man
So I ain't complainin'
Now these things is changin'
No more lames is hanging
No more fame in famous
Ain't no shame in shaming
She wanna give you the cookie, you Famous Amos
She gave you the pussy, but you ain't pay for the anus
Now your name is tainted, by the claims they paintin'
The defendant is guilty, no one blames the plaintiff
Gotta say it in Layman's terms, while you wait on arraignments
Cause if the jury say you did it, the payment is heinous
Give me one minute, my lady just fainted
My babies is crying, you understand what I'm sayin'?

One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's, m-i-i-ine!

Ahaha
Black man, black man
Fake eyes, black man
Fake eyes, black man
Fake eyes, black man
Fake, I want more!
Fake eyes, fuck man

One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's mine
One minute, one minute, gone
One minute and the next one's—

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky, are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now,
wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky, are like shooting stars?

I could really use a wish right now,
wish right now, wish right now

Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I'm late

I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky, are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now,
wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky, are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now,
wish right now, wish right now

Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
I'm guessin' that if we can make some wishes out of airplanes
Then maybe, oh maybe, I'll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game

And back when ain't nobody listened to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur—what's up, Bobby Ray?
So can I get a wish to end the politics

And get back to the music that started this shit?
So here I stand and then again I say
I'm hopin' we can make some wishes out of airplanes

Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky, are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now,
wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky, are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now,
wish right now, wish right now

I could really use a wish right now
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
Like, like, like shooting stars
I, I, I could really use a wish right now
A wish, a wish right now

She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side

She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right
She got your number
How does it feel
To know the stranger
Is out to kill
She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only erase the past
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side

She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right
Susie got your number
Susie ain't your friend

Look who took you under
She stuck seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife

Susie got your number
You know Susie says it's right
It was blood on the dance floor

And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it

She invites me to the condo
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago 
My side piece, but she's also
Someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed

But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow
'Cause moments like these are to die for
And she's clear, all nice and easy
As hair when I'm bleaching it blonde
So we got that lightning in a bottle

She's tipsy, I'm sober
So she gets a chip on her shoulder
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on
She goes, "All that old school hip-hop is over
Think that shit's got pneumonia."
I told her, "Bitch, now, just hold up!"
That's why rap needs a doctor
Our genre's lymph nodes are swole up
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis
'Cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts
That's why Tribe is so vital:  we need Q-Tip for the culture
Speed it up a little bit!
You ain't dealin' with a fuckin' featherweight
I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin' bellyache
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake
I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate
Demented with the pen, I'll make the mothafucker detonate
I wanna make it acapella—wait, I gotta set a date
With the devil and celebrate, together we can renovate
And re-develop hell awaits, and I'ma get a special place
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed
Like I'm a meteorite, and mothafuck the fucking media
Right in the behind; I'm a human encyclopedia
I must be like pie crust because I was bred to rise like I was yeast
And you're never gonna reach these heights
They're just too high to reach
And I ain't even reached my fuckin' highest
You better pick another game, try hide-and-seek
And you might wanna decide to cheat
'Cause you gotta open your eyes to peek
Am I indeed the last of a dying breed?
Even if you fire-breathe, it ain't shit you can say to inspire heat
If you wrapped your entire meat pad up in a dryer sheet
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of fuck it

Better not use me as your topic
Anybody who brings me up, duck it
Let me keep it one hundred
Two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion
The queen and her husband
Last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty 
Whatever you want, you can have from me 
I want your love, just lead me on
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey
'Cause I'm a sucker for ya
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang

Yo, now let me hit you back
Told 'em I'd get you back
I know you sittin' there just thinkin' 'bout who did you that
I am who did you that

You trippin', did you pack?
Can't post on Nicki block unless you sellin' Nicki crack
Here, take a Nicki pack
Check out this Nicki act
Nicki this, Nicki that
All these bitches piggyback
Ha piggyback, ah, ah, ah back
Ah, ah, ah back, ah, ah

Out ah road they lovin' my style
The mandem want digits to dial
Inna the dance, we a go skin out I know
And when I come out, gyal suicidal
Yeah, on the real, I'm these bitches' idol
Gotta be dumb to make me your rival
'Cause I'm too powerful , and you not powerful 
So say your prayers 'cause you 'bout to die slow 
Die slow , die slow 
Jealousy is a disease, die slow 
Die slow , die slow 
Tell her that jealousy is a disease, die slow

Yeah
Ahh
So what you waiting for, anticipating more
While you debate what it can take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I've been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before

But you could never see it, your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe, but this is take a shot time
While you're waiting for a purpose, I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like "1, 2, 3, 4"

And if I do what you demand

You'll let me understand

You're gonna hold me to your word

And if I sell myself away

I'll have no debt to pay

I'm gonna get what I deserve

Your word, obeyed!
My debt, repaid!
Our trust, betrayed!
All for nothing! all for nothing!

Kick back, there's no other way to say it
So, let me break this fucker down for ya
I really don't know ya
You talk, but let me show you where to put your paranoia

You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made you
Tuck your tail below ya

And no, I'm not your soldier, I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five-star general infantry controller
Need a lesson, let me show you
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like "1, 2, 3, 4"

And if I do what you demand

You'll let me understand

You're gonna hold me to your word

And if I sell myself away

I'll have no debt to pay

I'm gonna get what I deserve

And if I do what you demand
You'll let me understand

Your word, obeyed!
My debt, repaid!
Our trust, betrayed!
All for nothing! all for nothing!
All for nothing! all for nothing!

Last day of the rest of my life
I wish I would've known
Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye

I didn't tell her that I loved her, how much I care
Or thank my papa for all the talks
And all the wisdom he shared

Unaware, I just did what I always do
Everyday, the same routine
Before I skate off to school

But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
Instead of taking a test
I took two to the chest

Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
Everybody was running
But I couldn't hear nothing

Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
I don't really know this kid
But I sat by him in class

Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
Or maybe for a moment
He forgot who he was
Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
Whatever it was
I know it's because

We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation

Little Suzy, she was only twelve
She was given the world
With every chance to excel

Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
She might act kind of proud
But no respect for herself

She finds love in all the wrong places
The same situations
Just different faces

Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
Too bad he never told her
She deserved much better

Johnny boy always played the fool
He broke all the rules
So you would think he was cool

He was never really one of the guys
No matter how hard he tried
Often thought of suicide

It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
He put his life to an end
They might remember him then

You cross the line and there's no turning back
Told the world how he felt
With the sound of a gat

We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation

Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
No matter what you say
It don't take away the pain

That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
Don't nobody know why
It's the blind leading the blind

I guess that's the way the story goes
Will it ever make sense
Somebody's got to know

There's got to be more to life than this
There's got to be more to everything
I thought exists

We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation
We are, we are,  the youth of the nation

Youth of the nation... we are...

Man that's really all I use her for as I kick her out the door
I don't want her, you can keep the whore, she fiendin' for some more
In New York my niggas don't Milly Rock, my niggas money bop
Blow a case a nigga throwin' shots, I run 'em off they block
Quarter milli in the stash box, I grinded for my spot
Niggas talking 'bout that cash but my bag worth a lot
I don't fuck with no old hoes, only new hoes
Put my dick in her backbone, I pass her to my bro
I don't love her that's a sad ho, she a bad ho
I'ma fuck her then I dash home, to the cash ho

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch

Niggas iffy, uh, Blicky got the stiffy, uh
Got the blicky, uh, drum it holds fifty, uh
Move milli', all my niggas on fifty, uh
Talk down, pew pew pew, you silly, uh
Hit a stain, fifty bands, all hunnids
Spinning through ya block like a pop shove-it
Shoot at me I'm shooting back, I'm getting buckets
I ain't wanna take his life but nigga, fuck it

I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch
I'm on some rob a nigga shit, take a nigga bitch
Do the dash in the whip, count the cash in the whip
I pull up with a stick, I let that shit hit
Shout out... but I fucked that nigga bitch

"There's a time when the operation of The machine becomes so odious

Makes you so sick at heart
That you can't take part.
You can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies Upon the gears and upon the wheels, Upon the levers
upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it STOP!!! ."
To save face how low can you go
Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know
Static on the way make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got
Don't be absurd
Don't fight the power
Nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet then I'm letting you know

There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals take control
Hear us now clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you
So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And I'm running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between
The kick and the hi hat
The pen and the contract
The pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I'm letting ‘em know

There ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
So push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Now everybody go
Steel unload, final blow
We the animals take control
Hear us now clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals beat them low

Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ‘em up real high

Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ‘em up real high

Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ‘em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ‘em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ‘em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ‘em up real high
"There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all." -Mario Savio

Up in the club wit my homies, trying to get a lil V-I
Keep it down on the low key 
You should know how it feels 
I seen shorty she was checking up on me
From the game she was spitting in my ear
You would think that she knew me 
I decided to cheat  Conversation got heavy! 
She had me feeling like she's ready to blow! 
Oh!  She's saying "come get me!" 
So I got up and followed her to the floor
She said "baby let's go"
When I told her  I said

 Yeah - yeah
Shorty got down on me, said come and get me
 Yeah - yeah
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
 Yeah - yeah
Covering my girl, she be the best up on me
 Yeah - yeah
Next thing I knew, she was all up one me screaming

 yeah yeah  yeah yeah - yeah!

She's all up in my head now
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good idea to take her with me
Cause she's ready to leave  
And I got to keep it real now
Cause on a 1 to 10, she's a certified 20
But that's just ain't me 
Cause I don't - know, if I take that chance
She swears he's gonna leave
But what I do - know, is the way she dance
Make shorty alright wit me
The way's she's Getting Low!
I'm like yeah, just work that out for me
She asks for one more dance, and I'm like yeah
How the hell am I supposed to leave? 
And I say.

Yeah yeah - yeah!

Watch out, my outfit's re-di-culous
In the club looking so conspicuous
And RAWR! These women all on the prowl
If you hold the head steady, I'm a milk the cow
And forget about game, I'm a spit the truth!
I won't stop till I get em in their birthday suits!
So gimme the rhythm and it'll be off wit their clothes
Then "bend over to the front! and touch your toes!"
I - left the Jag I took the Rolls
If they ain't cutting then I put em on foot patrollll 
How ya like me now?
When my pinky's baguette over three hundred thou-sand!
Let's drink, you the one to please
Ludacris fill cups like double D's
Me and Ush' once more, and we leaves em dead
We want a lady in the street, but a freak in the bed that say.

 Yeah - yeah
Shorty got down on me, said come and get me
 Yeah - yeah
I got so caught up, I forgot she told me
 Yeah - yeah
Covering my girl, she be the best up on me
 Yeah - yeah
Next thing I knew, she was all up one me screaming

Take that, rewind it back

Take that, rewind it back

Take that, rewind it back

The way she came into the place I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl

The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion

As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust

The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend
We didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I felt trapped
Into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point of no return

Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity

This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous

I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous

I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine

I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby

And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of a strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil
But her inner spirit as sharp as a two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me

Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine

I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies and they cut so deeply

You can't get enough
You take and take and take
And never say no

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down
No

You'll never get out of sight
You push it back down
Blackout
Blood in your eye

You say that it's not your fault
And said that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run to the back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough
You take and take and take and take and take
Fuck it are you listening
No

You got to get out of sight
You push it back down
You push it back down

Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
Floating up you pass us in the night
The future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go

Come down, oh

Come down, oh

Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little whack
And my friends are just as screwy as me

I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they?
I ain't nobody

Got nothing in my pocket
Beverly Hills
That's where I want to be
Living in Beverly Hills

Beverly Hills
Rolling like a celebrity
Living in Beverly Hills
Look at all those movie stars

They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that

I wanna be just like a king
Take my picture by the pool
Cause I'm the next big thing
Beverly Hills

That's where I want to be
Living in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills

Rolling like a celebrity
Living in Beverly Hills
The truth is I don't stand a chance
It's something that you're born into

And I just don't belong
No I don't
I'm just a no class, beat down fool
And I will always be that way

I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play

Some day, some day
Some day I'll, I will wear a starry crown

Some day, some day
Some day 
I wanna lay down
Like God did, on Sunday
Hold up, hold up
Some days, some days
I remember this on some days
Back way, yeah way, way
Some day, mmm, mmm

Some day
I wanna tell everybody
Some days
I wanna hit the red dot, I'll never find
Some days, some
Smokin' marijuana
Now I'm livin' high, doin' what I wanna someday

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me

Some day we gon' set it off
Some day we gon' get this off
Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Some day the drama'll be gone
And they'll pray .. no, oh, no
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine
Years ahead but way behind
I'm on one, two, three, four, five
No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This now, with good in mind
But maybe some day

I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me
I've been tryin' to make you love me
But everything I try just takes you further from me


Oh, once again I am a child
I let it all go, of everything that I know, yeah
Of everything that I know, yeah
And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed

Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah
I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed
Yeah, and nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free
We're still the kids we used to be, yeah, yeah

This is war with no weapons,
Marching with no stepping,
Murder with no killing,
Illing every direction.
First, no sequel,
do the math, No equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people
And no I'm not afraid of that
Print in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement
Bang
Fade to black

In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And and there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
In the wastelands of today

Roll credits, to get it,
The show's done,
They're talking for just talking,
But meaning they got none,
None of 'em come proper,
They talk like a shotgun,
But how many got bred with integrity,
Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me,
Ain't a way to shake the ground I built before you came to be,
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy,
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and
And wait and see...

In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And and there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
And your hope turns into fear,

In the wastelands of today!

In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And and there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
And your hope turns into fear,
In the wastelands of today!

In the wastelands of today!
In the wastelands of today!

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here, good goodbye
Don't you come back no more

Live from the rhythm, it's something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me, you're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix, you won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad, somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one, there's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact that it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus headed back where you're from

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye, good goodbye, good goodbye, good goodbye

Goodbye, good riddance, a period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate, maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date, every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows, showing out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne, King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen, the old lineup where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him? Did you care for him? You were dead wrong
Don't you come back no more

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye, good goodbye, good goodbye, good goodbye

Let me say goodbye to my demons, let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness, tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me, tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes, you can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks, now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoes, goodbye to the cold roads, I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast, and now I'm inside with my bro-bro's gang

So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye, good goodbye, good goodbye, good goodbye

I'mma be that nail in your coffin
Saying that I softened, I was ducking down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience; before you even say it, I know
You let your pride or your ego talk slick to me, no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds

I want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

What is it you want me to tell you?
I'm not the failure, I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to
Push me to let you know you can't intimidate me
You disrespect me so clearly, now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds

I want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself
You did it to yourself, you did it to yourself

I want to see you choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies, swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes

Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days of the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed so never mind
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher, the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get into where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on motherfucker
'Cause all this bullshit, it made me strong motherfucker

So I pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!

Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
 And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherfucker I'm gone

Motherfucker I'm gone
Uhhhh!

I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven sent, and you're hell proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Uhhh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wise

Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
So I could pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, ha ha yeah!

Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
 And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth

Motherfucker I'm gone
Motherfucker I'm gone
I'm gone
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know

If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push comes to shove I just stand up and scream 'Fuck 'em all! '
Man it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, but it's time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in
my book of rhymes-got em cookin' boy
crooked mind of mine-got them all sAnd-scared to look in my-eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock, I took the time
And I-came up from behind and- pretty much snuck up
And butt fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear one way or another I'm a make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'm a fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently bitch, it's beddy bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die
My head is swole, my confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal, I'm unstoppable
Incredible hulk you're trapped in my medicine bowl

I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin, dawg
I split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives
I'll fuckin'
Pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head, yeah!

Bitch, imma pick the world up and imma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now rebirth motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth
Motherfucker I'm gone
Motherfucker I'm gone
I'm gone

Last night I let the party get the best of me

Waking up in the morning
Two hoes laying next to me
Plus I heard an officer arrested me
Good weed and cold drinks
That's the motherfucking recipe
Nigga and we roll deep, so deep
It's going down in this bitch
Concrete
We gon' party all night

No sleep
Tell the owner them is all my guys
So tonight everything is on me
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free

Get high, I mean so high
We don't see the whole suite
Then fly to a level where you gonna need your own key 

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Leaving from the club now she wanna stay with us
Came to spend it all, don't care what I'm paying for
Used to be too young, now I'm out here buying the bar
Everytime I look up, it's another red cup
Bunch of niggas in the game but they ain't playing with us
They just paying enough

Man them niggas ain't ballin. they just laying it up
Saying they does, I'm just rolling hella weed up
while on my way to the club
I had to wait at the club

But now I don't cause everything is on me
The drinks is on me
The bitches, the hotel, the weed is all free
Get high, I mean so high
We see the whole street
We fly, I mean so high
We need a whole wing 

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I
Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party lets party alright, I

No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long
No driving, no sleeping
Live it up like it's the weekend
When the DJ
Play the right song
Gon' drink, gon' party all night long

Party all day, party all night
Say you wanna party, let's party alright, I

Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated

I place blame when you steal
Place shame when you steal
Feel like you ain't shit
Feel like you don't feel, confidence in yourself
Breakin' on marble floors
Watchin' anonymous strangers tellin' me that I'm yours
But you ain't shit I'm convinced your talent's nothin' special
What can I blame him for
Nigga I can name several
Situation had stopped with your little sister bakin'
A baby inside, just a teenager where's your patience
Whats your intentions where is the influence you speak of
You preached in front of 100, 000 but never reached her
I fuckin' tell you, you fuckin' failure you ain't no leader
I never liked you, forever despise you I don't need you
The world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
Numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, thats for dedication
Thought money would change you, made you more complacent
I fuckin' hate you, I hope you embrace it

Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated
Loving you is complicated

Lovin' you, lovin' you, not lovin' you, one hundred proof
I can feel you vibin', recognize that your ashamed of me
Yes I hate you too

House keeping
*knocks*
House keeping
¡Abre la puerta! ¡Abre la puerta tengo que limpiar el cuarto!
¡Es que no hay mucho tiempo tengo que limpiar el cuarto¡! Disculpe!

Are you the reason why mama and them leavin'
No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don't mean it
I know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin' out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain't no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say "you fuckin' failed"
You ain't try

I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin' nigga
Y'all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin' to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you *gulp* I'm bout to hurl
I'm fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can't get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say "you gotta go"
And if I told your secrets
The world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

She dances in the sheets at nights
She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
"Sir, I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind

She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

She works so hard, just to make a way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love

Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You can not catch me, can not hold me
You can not stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more.
'Cause I know what its like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate.
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I've been waiting for it so long, so long
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A King can only rein 'till instead
There comes that day, it's of his head.
The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy, then when you're gone
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
And I told them; nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You can not catch me, can not hold me
You can not stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care, it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more, some more
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!
The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes!
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Oh... Oh... Oh...
Waiting for a light that never comes!

Together we made it
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall

See a nigga survived the worst but my life is glorious
But, I know that I live to be hurdled and I'm so victorious
Take a look, I'm a symbol of greatness now call a nigga Morpheus
As force accumalted the wind and but a believe I'm so notorious
You know I've been buying my bread even though we rapping now 
And now when you look on my trip and you a nigga higher level tramping now
And you see that everyone on my middle struggles and
For your ass is never been an option
A nigga paper long like we was on the trap and I'm about to take the hood choppin
Get it!

Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 
Forever we waited 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But, we took it on the road 
On the road 
On the road  {yeah, yeah}
On the road  {yeah, yeah}
On the road {yeah, yeah, yeah, yo!}

When it all got started we was steadily just getting rejected
And it seemed like nothing we could do would ever get us respected
At best we was stressed and the worst they probably said was we're pathetic
Had all the pieces to that puzzle just a way to get connected
And I was fighting through every ryhme tighting up every line
Never resting the question if I was out of my mind
And it finally came time to do it or let it die
So, put the chips on the table and told me to let it ride
Sing it! Ya!

Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 
Forever we waited 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But, we took it on the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 

Look, in case you mis-understanded exactly what I'm building
The shit that I could live for my children  children 
Now, I only wake up I smile to see how far I've come
Fighting for sales on a strip to get hustle from
From nights in jail on a bench using my muscles son
To count money like Dre, and Jimmy and Russell Ones 
But, now I live when I dream you see me finally getting it 
Let's make a toast to the hustle regardless how we get it
Singing!

Together we made it 
We made it even though we had our backs up against the wall 
Forever we waited 
And they told us we were never gonna get it
But, we took it on the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road 
On the road

Dry tears with a dollar bill, I'm out tryna make a mill', oh
Why you wanna take my soul? I'm yelling out hell no!
I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes

Watch these hoes when they say they wanna lie to me
I don't know who's the one that wanna plot on me
I stay low so my demons don't acknowledge me
When I go, I know death don't do apologies

For things that they can't afford, I gotta grab the sword, preach
I gotta thank the lord
I gotta go record 
I wanna be fly to soar
'Cause niggas be trying to floor me
People be thinkin' that I won the lottery
So paranoid, I don't know who be plotting on me
I don't know what trapped the virtue
I'm feeling like Raichu 'cause everything shocking to me
Gotta be aware of the wicked, the time will be ticking
Them niggas still clocking on me
Lord is my witness, I handle my business
You niggas ain't never ball blocking on me

I just wanna feel myself, you want me to kill myself
Man I been on my own, Lord, I'ma need some help

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

I know you wanna get behind the wheel but only one rider
Eyes shut still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to japan quake losers and surviours
Norway no you didn't get my flowers
No way to sound better but the killer was a Coward
Face just showers, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news all day went sour
Litl mama got me feeling like a limit here
Put you in the box just the Presidents ciggarettes
Give em my regards or regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers just the young & restless
Get mad coz the quarter million on my necklace
DUI never said i was driving reckless
You & I or jelaously was not oppressive
Oh no I can't stop I was Destined

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go...

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

Champange buckets still got two tears in it
And I put that on my tatoo of Jimi Hendrix
Get depressed coz the outfit all in it
Coz the press tell it all get a meal ticket
Clean next get a call just a litl visit
Sacrifice just to make a hit still vivid
Rihanna kiss you on ya neck just kill critics
Buggatti never when I´m rich, just God fearing
Look at me steering, got the bossing staring
Mr. Mike Caren, tell his Billie Jeans
I´m on another planet
Thank E-Class, Big Chuck or Lee Prince Perries
Buy my momma chandeliers on my tears dammit
Thirty years you had thought these emotions vanish
Tryna live tryna figure how my sister vanish
No cheers I know you wouldn´t panic

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go...

I know
Caught up in the middle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go
Oh no
Gave up on the riddle
I cry, just a little
When I think of letting go

When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now
When I need a healing, I just look up to the ceiling
I see the sun coming down I know its all better now

I know, I know, I know, I know

I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Shawty, I roll up
I roll up, I roll up

It's your anniversary isn't it
And your man ain't acting right
So you packing your Damier luggage up
Calling my cell phone, trying to catch a flight

You know one thing straight
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home, that's your man
Soon as you land you say it's all me

'Cause shit ain't all G with him, no more
You ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago
You ain't been the same

Not saying I'm the richest man alive
But I'm in the game
As long as you keep it 100
I'ma spend this change

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up

I try to stay out your business
But on the real you're so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fucking up
Your man's gonna catch onto us

That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling, I got a spot where I can put you on this medical
And send you home, doctored up

You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rolling weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money, I know I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky, now you say you in orbit

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up

No matter where I am, no matter where you are
I'll be there when it's over, baby
'Cause I was there from the start
Don't matter if I'm near, don't matter if you're far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And I'll be there when you call

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up
Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie
I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up
I roll up, I roll up, I roll up, whenever you call, baby, I roll up...

Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees

I just need to clear my mind now
It's been racin' since the summertime
And I'm holdin' down the summer now
And all I want is what I can't buy now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I told you to wait
Yeah I told you to wait
So I'mma need a little more time now
Cause I ain't got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah, I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin' me
All want somethin' out me
Then they talk about me
Would be lost without me
We could've been somebody
Thought you'd be different 'bout it
Now I know you not it
So let's get on with it

We could've been somebody
'stead you had to tell somebody
Let's take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body
And came out of your body
Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin' that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there ain't wrong with me
Something strange is happening

You could've been somebody
We could've ugh, we could've been somebody
Or was it on the first party
When we tried our first molly
And came out of our body
And came out of our body
Before they call lawyers
Before you tried to destroy us
How you gon' lie to the lawyer?
It's like I don't even know ya
I gotta bring it back to the 'nolia

Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
Fuck them other niggas cause I'm down with my niggas
I ride with my niggas, I'll die for my...

To all my second string bitches, try and get a baby
Trying to get a baby, now you talkin' crazy
I don't give a damn if you used to talk to Jay-Z
He ain't with you, he with Beyoncé, you need to stop actin' lazy
She Instagram herself like #BadBitchAlert
He Instagram his watch like #MadRichAlert
He only wanna see that ass in reverse
Two-thousand-dollar bag with no cash in your purse
Now you sittin' courtside, wifey on the other side
Gotta keep 'em separated, I call that apartheid
Then she said she impregnated, that's the night your heart died
Then you gotta go and tell your girl and report that
Main reason cause your pastor said you can't abort that
Now your driver say that new Benz you can't afford that
All that cocaine on the table you can't snort that
That going to that owing money that the court got
All in on that alimony, uh, yeah-yeah, she got you homie
'til death but do your part, unholy matrimony

That summer night holding long and long, ‘din long
Now waiting for the summer rose and 
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And breathe and breathe
And live and learn
And live and learn
And living and living like I'm lonely
Lonely, lonely
And living all I have
And living all
And live
And live

OK, I won't deny it
Half the time you send a text, yep, you know I'm not replying
Just to let you know, I'm not one of them niggas you be dodging
I'm the one that you dodge with
I'm the one that you gon' take that dress you saving out the closet
I'm the one you need alone
I'm the one that when you round your friends, that you gotta put on speakerphone
Just so you can let them know what we be on, like he the one
Yeah yeah, I know I'm young but you respect me like a father figure
Young mobbish nigga, probably make you farther figures
Sean Don Perrier out in Paris with a pair of Ye's going
Well, I would tell you but I gotta paraphrase
And even when you tripping, we tripping, I pay for ya
Gourmet for ya, chauffeur arranged for ya
I'll take that flight alone earlier in the day for ya
Just to beat you there and prepare, let you know I'm waiting for ya
Finally famous

I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?
You don't ever see the big picture

I want you to take me serious

Baby, I want you to take me serious

Wait, wait, waiting for ya
I be wait, wait, waiting for ya
You've got a young boss nigga like me waiting for ya
You've got that bomb ass pussy, I've been waiting for ya
Who ya love? Tell me who you fucking love
Tell me who you wanna fuck and love
I left that sexy dress out on the bed with a note there laying for ya
With directions where I'm waiting with dinner and waiter for ya
I'm that nigga, she tell me I'm that nigga
I'm the nigga that's your nigga even when you got a nigga
That you make love with, but right before take drugs with
Then right after, hit the tub, wait on me with suds
Then you back that ass up on me like it's 99
Wine fine, like a bottle from the 99
Hit you with the 99 like it's fucking primetime
Killed the pussy, had to hit that shit like nine times
Girl, even when I'm gone, just know I'm there for ya

I'm all ears, in other words here for ya
I'd probably rob a fucking bank and go to jail for ya

As long as I can smack that ass and pull that hair for ya
Finally famous

I ain't like them other niggas
And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?

You don't ever see the big picture
I want you to take me serious

Baby, I want you to take me serious

I've been waiting on that ass all night though
Girl, don't keep me waiting no more
Yeah, yeah

Got some things I wanna do to you, baby
Oh

And I ain't bout to play no games with you
You know what your problem is?
You don't ever see the big picture
I want you to take me serious

Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say hi and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
Cause they got nothin' on you, baby 
Nothin' on you, baby


I know you feel where I'm comin' from 
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done 
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun 
On the carousel, so around I spun 
With no directions, just tryna get some 
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun 
And so I lost more than I had ever won 
And honestly, I ended up with none 

There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know 
But never mind that, we should let it go 
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode 
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go


Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby

They might say hi , and I might say hey 
But you shouldn't worry about what they say 
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby


Hands down, there will never be another one
I been around and I never seen another one
Because your style they ain't really got nothin' on
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic
Stop, now think about it

I've been to London , I've been to Paris 
Even way out there to Tokyo 
Back home down in Georgia  to New Orleans 
But you always steal the show 
And just like that girl you got me froze 
Like a Nintendo 64 
If you never knew, well now you know


Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby

They might say hi , and I might say hey 
But you shouldn't worry about what they say 
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby


Everywhere I go I'm always hearin' your name
And no matter where I'm at, girl, you make me wanna sing
Whether a bus or a plane, or a car or a train
No other girl's in my brain and you the one to blame

Beautiful girls, all over the world
I could be chasin' but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby

They might say hi , and I might say hey 
But you shouldn't worry about what they say 
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby

Nothin' on you, baby


Yeah, and that's just how we do it
And I'ma let this ride

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

Uh, Uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it

Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers

And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers

You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A
You know what?
It's like I'm 17 again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin', on the case

Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I'm on the chase, Chevy

It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it

Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay

Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint
Up front, four blunts, like, "Khalifa put the weed in a J"

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?

We're just having fun

We don't care who sees
So what we go out?

That's how it's supposed to be

Living young and wild and free
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there

There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up

That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yeah, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you're supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees
So what we go out?
That's how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free

I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one
It makes me think of how you act for me
You do favors and then rapidly
You just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Maybe someday I'll be just like you
And step on people like you do and
Run away of the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were
You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

You try to take the best of me
Go away

I want to be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand

I want to be in the energy, not with the enemy
A place for my head

Shut up... what!

I'm so sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest
I'm so sick of the tension 
Sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed 
While I find a place to rest

There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief, yeah
There's too much confusion
Mmm I can't get no relief

Yeah
I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You'd find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I'm still showing signs all attributed tonight
In the pitch black, it's too cold
I'm all alone take me back to the roads
I had to rode to get here and I'll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother's house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What's a brother for?
When I'm sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money, full of tears, full of war
I was a failed man and worse I couldn't give a fuck
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

Cause your world is the same as mine
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
That's why they live a lie
I don't think I'll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a love is at my side
There's no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You've seen mine, I think it's time I see yours
I bet you that we've been scarred by the same swords
Some are lost some are...
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I'm trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain't religious I'm a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I've been a joker, I've been a thief, I've been a rapper
I've been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter

All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta 


Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin':  "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" 
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', I'm with the band 
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend 

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta 

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar 
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra 
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, "¡No más!" 
They like, "Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars?" 
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? 
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack 
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks 
L.A. bitches always askin', Where the coke at? 
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar 

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies

Haven't let that thing loose, girl, in so long
You've been inside, know you like to lay low

Workin' hard, girl, everything paid for

Gotta hit the club, gotta make that ass jump
Gotta hit the club like you hit them mothafuckin' angles
With your phone out, snappin' like you Fabo
And you showin' off, but it's alright
And you showin' off, but it's alright 
It's a short life

Uh-huh! 
These hoes! 
Your boy! 
I made! 

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta make that jump, gotta make that, gotta, gotta make that
Gotta, gotta, gotta g-g-gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta
Gotta, g-g-gotta, gotta, gotta make that jump, jump 
Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up

Bend it over, lift it up, bend it over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, over, over, over, over, lift it up
Make that jump, jump
Bend it over, lift it up 
Bend it over, lift it up 

That's a real one in your reflection
Without a follow, without a mention
You really pipin' up on these niggas
You gotta be nice for what to these niggas?
I understand

Care for me, care for me, you said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me, said you'd be there for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd cry for me

Gotta hit the club like you hit them, hit them, hit them angles
It's a short life, yeah
Cry for me, cry for me, you said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me, why won't you live for me?

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You shoulda known better than to mess with me harder

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to somethin', likin' to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fuckin'?

It's like I loved you so much that now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might-might be me believing what you say that you'll never mean

Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singing this song
You were different from my last, but now you've got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

You used to be thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace 

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You shoulda known better than to mess with me harder

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby



I'm gonna l-l-l-love you until it hurts
Just to get you, I'm doin' whatever works
You had never meet nobody that'll do ya how I do ya
That'll bring ya to your knees, praise Jesus, hallelujah

I'ma make ya beg for it, plead for it
'Til you feel like you breathe for it
'Til you'd do any and every thing for it

I want you to fiend for it, wake up and dream for it
'Til it's got you gaspin' for air, and you lean forward
Till you have a cat scan to check on your mind
And there's nothing but me on it 

Now it's me time, believe that
If it's yours when you want it, I want it, promise I need that
'Til I'm everywhere that you be at, I can't fall back or quit
'Cause this here a fatal attraction, so I take it all or I don't want shit

You used to be, thirsty for me
But now you wanna be set free
This is the web, web that you weave
So, baby, now rest in peace 

I'm gonna love ya until you hate me
And I'm gonna show ya what's really crazy
You shoulda known better than to mess with me harder

I'm gonna love ya, I'm gonna love ya
Gonna love ya, gonna love ya
Like a black widow, baby

Bitch you gotta shake it
Till your camel start to hurt

Say the heels on your feet
With the strap around your ankles
Jangle, Jangle, Jangle
Call that bitch Bo'Jangles
Juicy like fruit or deuce like coupe deville
Used to get loose on the goose for real

Five dollars get your ass a table dance
If you got ten, then bring a friend
Hoe shake your ass to the song then

If you ain't gon' dance well don't then
Why you wanna waste a nigga song then
See your ass down doing nothing

Work it like a game that you playin' to win
Make that pussy fart for the ying yang twins

Sixteen bitches with thongs in one club
The home of the 5th rated bones and big butts
Nice big pussys splittin' all over the floor
Hornafied, can't deny, certified pro
On a pole upside down 
Did the sixty-nine plenty of times to pay her bill
Brawd say she a clerk by night she turn stripper
You don't wanna date her you tryin' so you can tip her

Ooooo... Shawty crunk on the floor wide open
Skeet so much they call her billy ocean
Row, like a 18-wheeler
That hoe fine, but this hoe a killa',
She's naked, she's soakin' wet,
She's naked, soakin' wet

Shake it like a salt shaker! 

Ooooooooooohhhh!

And you can start usin' yo head
You like to fuck, have yo legs open all in da butt

My mind keep telling me no 
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control 
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin 
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I  swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin


I want to seal it
These bitches wanna fuck us, we the realest
Like it or not, brain shoot to the ceiling
So many clothes in the closet, she looks like dealer
Ran up my racks with Rich Homie we're like the pilgrims
Pour out 4 of that super clean 
I got jelly beans in my billie jeans
I got Quan back cause I know he got my scene




Dad told me never trip about no bitch
Daddy told me to stay down and they're gonna lose
Granny told me pray to God, that's what I did
Gotta make a way for my kids
Me and Thug flying higher than a blimp
Eating on shrimp, looking down at the shrimps
If you see me with a limp, don't mistake me for a pimp
The 40 get heavy when you tote it on your hip
Me and Thug ready, going in for the kill
And Imma look confused



[Verse 3: Young Thug &
Got racks on racks on racks
I got zippers on all of my shoes
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin 
Diamonds black, I'm a walking night
Play with Thugger, scary sight
No shoestrings in these shoes, so I ain't tripping
I ain't worried bout shit, cause I got zippers on all of my shoes

Imma ball like Spalding nigga
I'm a blood Imma balla, you can call a nigga
And I'm smokin angel dust, yes my nigga
And I'm attracted to green like war niggas
Imma pull up late, Ricki Lake!
And my jewelry's no joke, shit frosted like flakes
I swear to God I'm baked like Easy Bake uhhh
I send a bank statement that shit sound like a taser
Yeah shawty like a shawty with a taser
Fly that bitch to LA she ballin like a Laker
I know not to tell and never speak to the neighbour
In fact I can't see them I'm on so many acres
Ever since I met shawty I feel like Hercules
And I'm smokin bales of weed cause it grow on trees
6 golds in my mouth like a set of keys
With my west boast blood bangin burgundy
Rich bags under my eyes nigga Birkin these
She say I want Victoria Secreeeets
And I fuck her long watch her decrease
Even though I'm a blood, she like "CC"
She get mad whenever I bring a BB
Shootin' a 223, DVD
Watch me shoot a foe, way down the street
Cost a whole hunnid band, band with the heat
Imma die for my clan, Ku Klux me
Diamonds red like a muhfucka cut me
And I smoke rusty and dusty

Hey, baby girl whatcha doin' out here?

If a pussy nigga play I'm gonna gun him down like a G

This a nitty beat

Here we go again, ghetto ville U.S.A
You know I got by the name nitty right
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker
Out my squad right

Dis nigga go by the name of Jock
He resides in College Park, right
But for right now what we gotta do for y'all
We gotta give y'all a hit

Niggaz in my face, damn near er' day
Askin' a million questions like, “Jock, where ya stay?"
Tell 'em College Park, where they chop cars
Eat 20 grand spend a grand at the bar

Jest bought a zone, Jay's on my feet
I'm on that patron so get like me
69 cutlass wit' the bucket seat
Beat in my trunk bought it just for the freaks

Catch me in the hood posted at the sto
Pistol in my lap on the phone countin' dough
If a girl choose let her do her thang
Just like her mama and I ain't sayin' the name brain

Everybody love me I'm so fly
Niggaz throw the deuces everytime I ride by
I know ya wonder why, I'm so cool
Don't ask me just do what cha do

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down
Meet me in the club it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down
Meet me in the club it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Verse numba 2, do the damn thang
Keeps on my neck pockets full of Ben Franks
When I'm in the mall hoes just pause
As I pop a few tags give me that on the wall

Time to flip the work make the block bump
Boys from the hood call me 'Black Donald Trump'
Dope boi magic seven days a week
Numba one record long as nitty on the beat

Oh, I thank they like me betta yet I know
Lights camera action when I walk through the door
Niggaz know my crew we certified stars
Ready in the front bout 35 cars

Bitches in the back, black beamer coups
Girls like girls, time to recruit
If ya got a problem say it to my face
We can knuckle up any time any place

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down
Meet me in the club it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down
Meet me in the club it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Time to set it off let these nigga know
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors?
I ride real slow no need to speed
Gotta make sure ya see the buckets on my feet

Feds on my trail but now thank I don't know
I keep my hands clean 'cause I never touch dope
Every time I see 'em look 'em in the eye
Ask 'em how? I know its me surprise

Put it in the air rep where ya stay
Take a step back blow the kush in they face
Stuntin' is a habit let 'em see the karats
I'ma make it rain nigga I ain't scared to share it

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down
Meet me in the club it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Meet me in the trap it's goin' down
Meet me in the mall it's goin' down
Meet me in the club it's goin' down
Any where ya meet me guaranteed to go down

Yung Joc, nitty strikes again
This a Nitty beat, Playmaker

It's not, it's not me exactly, who touches people
It's what I represent, the possibility that dreams from long ago
May still come true even if they, even if, even if
Even if they look lost forever

I had a homie named, Tony, 16, 6"2'
Headed to the NBA straight from high school
My nigga had his ball game on lock
But at the same time he was in love with the block

All the stuff that came wit it the drugs and the guns
The gangs, the slangs and all the funds
He just got a letter of contempt from the Cavaliers
Sayin' how they love him and they wish he was there

He had it made like, Special Ed about to get the bread
But chose to do somethin' dumb instead
Go to war wit the crew on the other side of town
And was more ready then Tony got laid down

He ain't even have a chance, died 'fore the ambulance
Even got to him so many went through him
I hate to tell the story but that's how it is
Growin' up in the hood as a kid

When you got big dreams don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside

When you got big dreams don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside, reach for the sky

I knew a girl named Gina that was a hell of a singer
And e'body fell in love wit her when they seen her
Babygirl was on the verge of signin' a big deal
Eighteen and life looked so surreal

She was stuck wit a dude that was all bad news
And all he ever did was give baby the blues
But she was true to a nigga do for a nigga
Pop, you and ya whole crew for a nigga

One night, he came, picked her up
Told her let's ride that's the same night
Daddy watched her die they was tryna hit a lick
But the lick hit back put a end to the deal
And all of that

She ain't even have to be there
He knew it wasn't right, now he gotta deal wit it
For the rest of his life and the part I don't like
He ain't even get grazed but the homegirl Gina
Is layin' in the grave

When you got big dreams don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside

When you got big dreams don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside, reach for the sky

I got a few relatives, given family drama
Always got they hands out
When they see me and my momma
One could have been a doctor the other a chef
But when he got his own kitchen
He was cookin' somethin' else

Now, his life in the drain, a triflin' shame
He all washed up, wife took e'thing
No car, no mo', no house and everywhere he go
He stole, so they throwed him out

I was growin' up lookin' up to be like them
Now, I'm throwin' up cash, rollin' up in the bed
I was stuck wit a dream I had since a shorty
I be damned if I let another man support me

Now, Uncle Junebuck's sick, skinny as hell
He got aids in his body from the needles he shared
E'time he get his welfare checks
He don't care, if you wanna see him go to the crack house
He there

When you got big dreams don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside

When you got big dreams don't listen to what nobody say
And don't let nobody turn you away
When you got big dreams keep your eyes on the prize
Don't fall to the wayside, reach for the sky

When you got big dreams, when you got big dreams
When you got big dreams, when you got big dreams
Keep your eyes on the prize don't fall to the wayside
Reach for the sky

uh-huh, uh-huh, UH.
106 & Park ain't been the same since I had it
So I'm back at it - freeze
Still a +juvenile+ at +400 Degrees+
Lil' girls still fallin' out, I'm still ballin'
Crawlin' out the hottest speeds on these ATL streets
From the Garden, to the box office, I shuts down both
And no matter where I go I'm still, O-H-I-Ohhhhhhh
E'rybody know this is MY turf!
Who had it crunk first, and had girls of all ages off one verse?
 Ain't nobody else can name
Another seventeen year-old manye that do it this HARD
"Oh LORD", that's what them old niggaz say about me
Young niggaz play, can't go a day without me
If bling was a drug, I'd DIE from an overdose
Fresh Prince to Sugarloaf, Homey I'm the most you've seen
I got the same affects on both coasts
And e'rything hot on fo' wheels, homey I'm ghost


Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy
When they see one, I would neva wanna be one
Do you - As long as it sound right
E'rybody in town like it
Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else
Do you

Not just the rap game, the whole industry the same
E'rybody wanna look and sound like the next manye
But I'm definite there ain't another me
And I'm So-So-Definite, back wit J.D
Back to give these little imitators sumthin' to talk on
Breathe, Stretch, let it go, homey get yo walk on!
Black Beat, Teen People, can't forget Right On!
A lotta things changed since the young don's been gone
What chug on roll with? The future is me!
Only youngins that's movin' units is.ugh.ME
Young Ali, float like a butterfly
Get up out them stores quick, why wouldn't you wanna buy?
The carbon copy, not the copy
Imitators mimic, but them guys is sloppy, heh, heh
As for me, I'm the leader of the new school
I can just ad-just, so the rest of y'all just


Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you - It's so-so sloppy and the fans know a copy
When they see one, I would neva wanna be one
Do you - As long as it sound right
E'rybody in town like it
Don't worry 'bout nobody else, else
Do you


See?!
It's rare to find people like us.
Everybody out there doin what I'm doin!
Or tryna do what I'm doin, you can't man!
At one point in ya life, man, you gotta get in yo own lane and stop swervin' in mine!
See what I do, I do my way!
What about you, huh?! HUH?! CAN YOU SAY THAT?!


Do you - stop tryna be me, stop tryna be he
Stop tryna do what you see
Do you - 'Cause right here is my love homey
Go back to where you came from and get yo own homey
Do you- 
Do you
Do you

Look me in my eyes, tell me what you see
Do you think I'm cra-zy? 
Sometimes I wanna die, maybe I'll be free
Free from all this bullshit that's constantly surroundin me
 I see when I'm asleep
I don't wish to discustin, cause it done been too deep
I'm tired of bein' stepped on, and past around like weed
Look me in my eyes 
and tell me what you see 
Can you see my future, and what lies down the line?
Is it just my test, or is it just my time?
Time for me to pay, for all the wrong I've did
I forgot to be picked off, when I was just a kid
A poison in my mind, tryin to find relief
But I can't get no peace, cause Shoemaukers been chasin me
Tryin' to set me up, bustin down my streets
Blockin' up my door, to see if he can catch me
But I don't sell no dope, so f**k what niggas say
F**k Ronnie Carbone, and f**k the D.E.A.
And f**k these undercovers, that lock me up for weed
You can search me all you want to, but you won't find no cheese
And I ain't finna snitch, cause I don't know a thang
Don't ask me shit bout Steve, don't ask me shit bout Jane
I know you crackrs pissed off, I can see it in your eyes
I'm down with Rap-A-Lot, until the day that I die

So f**k you in ya asses, you know it's all a lie
You just wanna destroy me, just like you did my guy
But now I must expose you, and tell my boys the truth
Listen up my niggaz: "The F.B.I. been watchin' you"
Especially if you black, and tryin to leave the streets
And get off in this music, you see the way they doin me
Runnin in my crib, makin niggaz lie
Nigga get a scapegoat and take this 25
You know I ain't no dopeboy, ain't never been a mule


I admit I use to sell rocks, but that was back in school
Now I just do music, and smoke a little weed
but not enough to run a dope house, so why you f**k with me?


Look me in my eyes!
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see what I see?
Will you look in my eyes, and tell me do you see a Geeeeeeeee?


Look me in my eyes, I've told all I could tell you
And now you know too much, if you leak a word I'll kill you
You think that I'm insane, partially deranged?
You've had your chance to pick my brain, now explain
What's up with all these nightmares, this long rewinding road
that leads me to the same place I started from;
right before I left home
 I thought you was a shrink
Diagnosed my symptons, I give you time to think
OK your time is up, now analyze my life
Please remove your glasses, look me in my eyes

You seemed to be confused, I raised up off his sofa
Put back on my shoes, because this sessions over
I headed for the door, he stopped me in my tracks
He said he had an answer, he told me to come back
He spoke the book of Matthew then he spoke the book of Luke
But he stopped at Revelations, when he just spoke the truth
And told me all my answers, I would find in his book
If I just stopped and looked, if I just stopped and looked
Told me to seek in he who seeks he shall find
Then he put back on his glasses, and looked me in my eyes
Looked me in my eyes

I'ma born killer, you're face to face with Scarface
You tried to ice an X, but thats a motherfuckin waste
Your schools fucked up G

Cause I don't weep and I don't sleep
Save that motherfucker black, cause talk is cheap
And uh, since you got beef
Lets take it to the streets and I'mma bring it to your ass G
I'm commin from the heart son
And I don't take no shit, but I'm about to start some
Now which one a you hoes wanna jump
If you got static, then get it off your chest punk
Cause I ain't bar none
If you're feelin lucky then go ahead and get cha some
I ain't with this fucked shit
If ya ain't in trick, then get your ass in ya trunk bitch
Cause I'm about to square it off
Hit ya ass in the chest with the tech and try to tear it off
Send you back to mommy, its a plastic
And hadda bitch out huntin for a casket
I'm on the for realla tilla my nilla
I'm a born killa


I'ma born killa
Born
Killa
"Don't fuck with me"

My momma did her part
But it ain't her fault that I was born with out a heart
In other words I'm heartless dude
I don't love me, how the fuck I'mma love you?
Thats right, you guessed it
I'm legally insane, marked mannick depressive
I'm takin all types a medication
To keep me out the mood of premeditatin
Yo, the log around my lone is worse
I'm havin thoughts of killin me, but I'm killin you first
Mr. Kindness talks but I don't listen
A victim of society fucked by the system
My whole life's been a see saw
I'm up one day, down and out on tomorrow
Right now I'm even more upset
Some shit that happened to me that I don't think I'll ever forget
You think I'll let it die, but I ain't
It ain't because I want to, its because I can't
I'mma getcha but I ain't goin into it
Cause ain't nothin to it but to do it
See it ain't no sweat to me
Cause in the fo place, you fucked up the minute that you stepped to me
I'm not your average dealer
I'mma born killa



Now I'm livin where I can cause I'm homeless
Can't make point calls cause I'm phoneless
I ain't, I'm starvin duke
I can't go to mommas house cause mommas starvin too
Better grab that 12 gauge
Cause thats the only way a niggaz gonna get paid
I'm on my way to my old bank
They know me real good and they don't think that I'd gank
Had my gun in my trenchcoat
Now getcha ass on the floor
And don't think about pushin that panic switch
I'm gettin paid and you're gettin killed bitch
Take notes to the message I gave ya
Ya dyin ho and can't nothin save ya
I'm doin bad, so I'm goin bad
Huh, and you never expected that from Brad
But theres a lotta things pressin me
And ain't the nigga to let the mortredresser dressin me
So I'm comin out winnin
100, 000 in the case now I'm comin out grinnin
But the shit didn't flow smooth
The security guard had to run and pulla hoe move
He reached for his pistol
The 10 gauge went "BOOM" shoulda heard that motherfucker whistle
Hit him in his chest
Now which one a you motherfuckers in here wanna die next?
Nobody made a move
And I got away smooth
And thats how it is nigga
I spared a couple a lives, but I'm still a born killa

I think I done fell in love, with my damn self
I'm the only one I'm thinking of, nobody else
They say they love me but I don't give a fuck 
Hell nah, cause when I was fucked up my people didn't give me no help
Now that a brother's balling hard, foes done turned to friends
I can see straight through that camouflage, still a hoe within
That's the reason I put my trust in God, I never put trust in men
If they fuck over you once they gone do it again and again and again
My biological father didn't teach me a lot I had to learn shit on my own
I'm just a thankful God fearing gangsta mane, thank you for easing a gangstas pain

I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
I said I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
Cause it ain't no more pain pain pain pain pain
I said it ain't no more pain pain pain pain pain
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy

Wing dinners and corduroys and turtle necks that's what I come from
No fancy clothes I couldn't talk to hoes that's the way it goes when you got nothing
They was laughing at me but I still was happy trying to ask my daddy am I your son
If I am can I get a little love instead of ignoring me like I'm a scrub
All my haters was talking down, entertained by my misfortune
Same nigga they was laughing at the same nigga driving Bentleys and Porsches
Hallways and  elevators and shit ain't no more porches
Money by the ton I donate my haters all my 1's
My biological father didn't teach me a lot I had to learn shit on my own
I'm just a thankful God fearing gangsta mane, thank you for easing a gangstas pain

I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
I said I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
Cause it ain't no more pain pain pain pain pain
I said it ain't no more pain pain pain pain pain
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy

Everyday the attorney general be trying to serve me and shit
The queen will call , you gone need medical attention like emergency bitch
And fuck a manslaughter I want murder, on some first degree shit
What you try to get from me in one year, that's just a purse to me bitch
Mother fuckers try to steal my joy but they can't though, might as well try to steal my bank roll
I'm a gangsta but I roll with God though, so when I say Church call me Sainte Ro
I love my life I wouldn't trade it, even with these obstacles I still made it
Even gave a club DJ my new CD didn't even pay the nigga but he still played it 
Hell nah I can't complain, too many problems to, too many diamonds mane
I've been counting money so long my hand got a cramp my people think I'm insane
Cause I'm smiling big for no reason even though it's raining outside
King of the Ghetto I could buy a pair of Jordan's for everybody on the Southside

I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
I said I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
Cause it ain't no more pain pain pain pain pain
I said it ain't no more pain pain pain pain pain
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy
And I'm so thankful I've got joy joy joy joy joy

Everybody fin to die, by the hands of the dark angel adjust
Snatching your breath, till it dims up your chest
How much pain, can I manifest
When I come to wreck, ripping through your flesh techs
My killers you'll never see, invisible invisible are we
Unseen like ghosts, strike like infrared beams make toast
We smoke the most, but never bump the most
Our figgas unleash like ropes, around throats
Better feel the attack, cause we cloak in the image of smoke
Leaving motherfuckers broke like a king of jokes, mercy
I know not of a feeling, but the thriller
Of a killer gets my adrenaline rushing
Never stopping, watching niggas dropping
More breaking blood gushing, I done opened the wounds
As I destroy cities with typhoons, and masoons
Your doom has awaited, all your mercy's forsaken time to die
Gotta kill them all, every nigga fin to fall when I kill them all
Found them up in bombs, ywith stomach punches
Yelling and running, K of dynasty coming


Mortuless contender, Guerilla Maab member I be
It'd be an epidemy, hoes wanna get rid of me
Fin to be, found dead and deceased
This ain't no game, ain't a damn thing changed
Cause I came, to bring the pain
Glock ass still fits, running on they head
while they play it, I rise up in chains
Hag in here, hag in here more deadly than anyone's intention
It had to be, more casualties
While I'm in more blemishes, than fatal inflictions
Slice them up like a wolverine, but I use a machete and a guillotine
Wanna stop like Akeim, on my god damn dream
And now mark and ass niggas, recognize my team


Murderer in me, I love to see you bleed


The murderous feeling, is killing your kin
And tripping them niggas up, with a 4-5
Hit the ground and running bud, then I probably bumping in blood
A fast thug fin to lose his life, motherfucking nigga from Texas
Steady with the dumb plexers, by the hand when I'm kicking your ass
And everybody better ball on
Cause I fuck around, and y'all gone and a nigga like me
Cause I'm blessed with a tight 22's, AK-47, 3-57, Mac 11
Balling and and a 25, bulletproof vest and a sharpened shank
Motherfucker your body gone stank, I'm flawless
Swinging and leaving them jawless
One of these niggas, are about to bleed
Running with the big dog, follow my lead
They following they mama straight, when we
Put him in the streets I'm a regular competitor
To the niggas, that I want to act surely
Everybody wanna live, let the early bird get the worm
Run up in the corner store bright early
Even though I be hanging with thugs
Giving mean mugs, and I do a lot of drugs till I pass out
When I smell a dirty rat, up all in my motherfucking face
I'm hunting they, motherfucking ass out
When I be stepping and pulling my whip
And I'm ready to go to war, with them niggas
That be stepping and pulling back, they fucking up grind
It's going down, load the clip in the gun and I'm making them run
A gorilla nigga evermore buck and he died, but who was the nigga
That's talking down, don't really want me to get an attitude
I'm slapping haters up out the niggas, that think of my trigger
Won't be getting no automatic beatdown, but that's what I live for no mercy




Walking the land, of a naked world
Looking down, up on my enemies in vein
With a mind full of deadly games, I'ma serve your aim
Shouldn't of killed putting holes in your frame, feeling no remorse
As deadly force overcomes my thugs, so bare witness
Sense of relentless vengeance, and 24 victims of wickedness
Out the hills of homicide, cause everytime I pull a whip enclosed
I can hear the sounds of bodies, from the victim of 17 and reloads
Did you really believe, that you could platinum-sieve a nigga like me
I was born to murder the world, but killers and G's and evil deeds
It'll be a whole lot of fly bringing
Some saying, if you run up on me the wrong way
I'ma be forced, to pull a AK
Bust your ass in the head, when the lead spray
No I'm not lying, I know you the fourth guy
To a region in mouth, no time to shine
You the dead victim of reincarnated, man for real I show no mercy

Guerilla till I die, mama don't cry
When they come for me, when I blast
We gon see how many of em run from me
Guerilla till I die, but I never shed a tear
Cause they don't love a nigga here


American me, could it be my own
War is out to murder me
I'm ready to kill, and I'm ready to die
But have these cowards heard of me
The rumors are real, better keep your glock cocked
Leaving em stiffer than a statue
Ready to defend, like a guerilla, by any
Means that I'd murder if I have to
Heard my homie's working as an undercover
Ready to kiss my cheek, and earn your silver pieces
Could it be that I've seen my last supper
Mighty Jahova, please protect my spirit from the danger
And I know you said you would strike down apon the
With great vengeance and curious anger
But don't attempt to poison your brother
Was it nothing but the word of God
That kept a nigga, from taking the lives of so many others
And I'm trying to keep ways right, brothers and mothers
I'm falling around a grave sight, pu-punk I hate you to death
But yet I loved you so, wanted you to feel my pain since 91
So brother come with me, and die slow
I hate you to death, but yet I loved you so
Wanted you to feel my pain since 91
So brother come with me, and die slow




As my life flashes before my eyes
Visions of wicked ways, keep me puzzled
Wondering why I was introduced to a life
Filled with drama and trouble
And everyone's always got something to say
When I come around, when I clown
Armed a deal, smile in my face
And stab me in my back, when I turn around
And I can feel hateful eyes, watching plotting to get me
They under estimate me, hate me
But never approach, cause they can't fade me
And I'll be damned if I go softly, shouldn't of crossed me
Guerilla till I die, and I'ma blast when they come for me
Please tell me is there a place, where my guerillas could see refuge
Cause it seems this time we gain one, as one more elute
Whatever the rules, whatever you choose, whatever you give, I accept
Just let me twist up, let me smoke one for the world before my last breath
How can I go on, how can I take away my anguish
I put a frown on my face, cause now guerillas are strangers
And nobody knows my soul, so I show no fear
Mobbing till I die, cause they don't love a nigga here




Could it be I'm too good for hell
Heaven don't want me, because I keep slippin'
Even though I got two clips, I still preach
Motherfuckers around had to be Christians
And I got a problem I suppose, but I know
I'm gon solve it with a 4-4, ten-six on fry
And I got 25's, hollin' I roll
But they tell me to keep my head up and finish my tape
Because its gon jam but I'm losing respect, my music can't hang
Around Z-Ro, just till we praying, I really don't know
All I can say, that I don't trust nobody on this earth
Been that away, ever since my birth
But its gotta stay that-a-away till I'm dying
Innocent niggas, risen up out of my business
Is something they better do, I'ma hit the I cut
When a fucker rolling rocks, sold em up even
Till I got rest, gotta put it down to the bullets
Dump a lot of bullets, till the job done
Till a nigga really wanna, kill myself
Nigga shut the fuck up, my record is spinning
I'm really trying to feel myself
Gotta get em all, gotta get em dead
When I'm filling the bed, put a infrared to the head
Everybody come up dead, better get on or get stole on
Nigga better get on, but I just can't hold on
Cause I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die
But next to steal, living on the motherfucking edge
Nigga don't run up, because its real
Nigga can you feel me

Stained all broke ass niggas in my mix, mix


I heard a stranger say geurilla till I die but motherfuckers be claiming
A name in vein nigga you ain't never witnessed the pain
But I got a diploma for making bitch niggas hold they jaw
When I pull a nine out, I'ma find out witch nigga told the law
When my homie was located incarcerated and simming on one
It's like going from heaven to slum, motherfucker now you know
This is dedicated to you, dear bitch
This is dedicated to the coward niggas of your click
Then jamming out killing to go and get the motherfuckers
but they fin to feel approach from behind
For the mighty motherfuckin power ranger danger becuase of my anger
Never been stranger to run in the chamber so run
Or I'll be coming across the chamber with my gun
No coming back, welcome to my world, I'll show you pain you never seen
Or slapping patches out of niggas and we mean it when we scream it
Never be given a good god damn so don't they go and get us started
Now it's time to show these niggas we the hardest
all I want to know is are you down


How many niggas want to ride with me
They say my mob is a threat to society
Because we mobbing in masks
Get the gauge and we blast
And quick to put a motherfucker on his ass
Are you down


Now which one of you niggas is fake
and tell me which one of you niggas are real
I might now find out now
but I guarantee if you cause me then I got your grill
Cause I don't feel, a nigga should chill, with me still
For me, smile in my face and stabbed me in my back seat
Obviously, that nigga ain't down with me
And he ain't who he claim to be, but it ain't no game to me
I take it seriously, and keep my eyes on my motherfucking enemies


Got to keep my distance g, cause i know they plotting on me
To set me up for a homicide or robbery
But it ain't no thang to me, cause I got my family
Killa Klan and Geurilla Maab coming cotastraphy
You get snatched if we, feel you less than a man
I'm in a clan where niggas trained to kill with that by hand
But they don't understand, untill they been there
Are you down or what, cause if not than beware



(Z-Ro}
Stained all broke ass niggas in my mix, mix


Now most of the time I'm by myself cause all of my friends are fake
How many more chins willI have to check
untill the bones in my wrist and my fist finally break
But I was born, as a child of the corn
Now between heaven and hell I'm torn and trapped in a motherfucking storm
I'm ready to kill and I'm ready to die, my mind is constantly gone on fry
You laughed when I bumped you off
then I jumped you off thinking it's about time
To close shop, get the nine glock, put a nigga in a pop box
I need some gin, instead of rate
the murder death kill of a nigga that really won't breath again
But there ain't another nigga that's as cold as I
And I'm gone hold on to my geurillas untill I'm told to die
But motherfuckers be coming in sets when they be rolling by
But motherfuckers are horizontal with a swollen eye
I'ma keep me a lean on rubatussin, got to keep me a glock that I be busting
I got to to keep my eyes open wider, motherfuckers be thinking they Mckeiver
Pull a stunt got a trick up they sleeve
hate me motherfuckers don't like breathing
When a geurilla like me never be leaving
I got a man with a verse that I be reading but are you down

Nobody seems to understand that my brain ain't stable
They got me out on the ledge
feel like I'm falling off the edge it ain't no fable
It's reality, feel like I'm on the offensive, they trying to tackle me
That's why I keep popping fists
So rather relative or stranger, better keep your distance
I can't determine friend or foe so you in danger
Chemical imbalances of the weed and cocaine, but it really
Don't matter to society, a nigga that got no face and no name
Deserving more, but I'ma mob until I ain't got nothing left
And the only thing that's promised to me is more problems and death
Cause there's some niggas looking for me and they might be near
And if they kill me don't shed a tear, remember I'm not happy here
Even still, got to keep my eyes on the prize
Although my vision is blurry I'm losing life in a hurry
Even my girlfriend don't understand, didn't want to
Witness the wicked so please find yourself another man, haters feel me


This is my liiiiiiiiife
Surviving in the struggle, living so shife


My opposition and proposition is scheming for cash
And if you bitches is scandalous, I get in that ass
So let's reliviate the pressure
Don't try to run it's guaranteed these slugs'll catch you
Oh yeah, I keeps a problem solver
A pistol grip, a automatic and revolver
Check it, and I'ma handle up baby
It's in my nature it's a must it ain't a maybe, peep game
The feds taking pictures, and tapping my phones
But if I catch you bitches snitching best believe me it's on
I analyze of this realize and open fire on bitches
And if I catch you bastards slipping I'm leaving bodies in ditches, huh
I bet that ass can pass it
Your life span it ain't long, you in a casket, check it
Niggas rushing your ass, mob deep with ski masks
Busting shots on the road trying to make your car crash, this is my life




These boys be telling me they got love, giving me false-i-fied tapping, but
I know they wouldn't give a fuck about me if there wasn't no money in rapping
See I know they want to get rich off me understand, even if I was
To die I still can talk they still put a mic in my hand
For trying to copy my style of life, pretending like they from my block
While I survive on willing to live while they depend on mom and pops
Before you make your move, check yourself and giving me for the millions
For the love of the struggle and just can't take it cause you not real
You want to be dead, there's gone be a dentist to see
When a nigga be scream and hollering I'm godfather
But I guess it's just the menace in me, plus
The only nigga that's skipping me from clicking is Herman Fisher
Relocated the killers and gats and drinking and if and burning swishers
Why they want to play with my life, they got families, nigga I don't
The only thing between me and them hoes
Is I'ma keep thugging they timid ass won't
Will they mind they own god damn business and keep they self out of mine
Because of a thin line, between handling business
and boo yeah coward a nine baby

Nigga you ain't my partna, but you never been
Just wanted to get in the club, free you little low yellow bitch
You ain't never been real, but it's evident
You be looking to get your chest blown 
Or are you use to walking the hallways
Of your home, with a vest on
Talking you come real, with the black steal
But you ain't never seen no glock
That's why Grady, checked your ass up out your hat
Cause you never lived on our block
But niggas be going off at the mouth
And I'm so sick of these hoes acting shife
Nigga really fin to lose, more than your teeth
Fuck around and be looking for your life
Cause I'm the nigga that showed you love
It's best you keep your distance from me
Even though we once was throwing up the same sign
I'll put your bitch ass to sleep, remember
I started the click you claim
And you wanted to trip when I left
Trying to catch me slipping in the truck on the titty
You niggas to put one scar on my chest
And a nigga would try to erase me, and that's a fact
But if I gotta go, really I'ma be
God damned, if my trigga finger, isn't pulling back
Even if they fuck around and murder me, for the the thangs I spoke on
I'm gonna be in the depths of hell, hollin' out fuck you as I smoke on


This is dedicated to you, dear bitch
This is dedicated to the coward niggas of your click
Welcome to my world, I'll show you pain you never seen it
Slapping patches out of niggas, and I mean it, remember


I know you smile in my face, full of jealousy and anger
But the minute I turn my back, I know you shoot me the finger
Whether you wanted to be my friend or foe, I know you ain't like me
But when I refused to sign your contract, niggas started to call me shiesty
But now one one of you niggas would fight me, even if you was jumping me
You won't be to the end, I take your life and crumble your company
When you first started off, I did all of your production for free
But for the show date, you got everybody in the club except me
What kind of hoe could you be, a bitch to the third degree
That's why me and 3, ran up in your crib
And wouldn't play, let you live
If it wasn't for your cousin, cause for him I got love
But Midas please quit fucking with them scrub ass
Never show love ass, selling fake drug ass
Fin to catch a slug ass niggas, and I bet I be the one behind the trigga
Fin to put you in the dirt, till you get hurt, fucking around with the Network
Deserve a motherfucking slug in the chamber
And when I blast I'm screaming




When I be played up in my back, but in my face or ear to ear
You must of heard of all the murders that we doing here
Cause I could smell your fear
And watch you coming, you can't fuck with a nigga from bud
I'll leave laying on your back, with your body wide open
Choking on your blood, I signed a contract that was about a year long
But now its expired, how the hell you gon get some points off my song
Bitch made nigga, show yo' face, even yo' nephew as well
Fuck around and pistol play with me, and you won't live to tell
Oh well, all I could say is I told you so
Should of stuck with a bench nigga like me, just got plex
You can't take it, talking bout what your pistol gon do to my chest
Hold that down, you don't wanna fuck around, I'm quick to pull chrome
But I'm more than words, up under your breath
And run tell chickens what's going on
Don't make me murder you nigga, you looking for me here I stand
About six feet even, cocked and meant built twin glocks in my hand
And to the niggas, that pulling the triggas on niggas like me
Sho' nuff gon stall, but I'm ready for the match
That's killing one more, one fall I'm killing on y'all
Nigga, let's get ready to rumble

I'm a player. I can't be dealing with this

After the first night I hit you with the mule
Now I'm sitting here looking like a fool
Cause this woman won't get out my bed
I gave her my number cause I took a chance
All I really wanted was a piece of ass
But ended up with something else instead
Why do you keep blowing up my phone
That's why my battery is always dead
I wish that you would just leave me alone
Give the pig feet to somebody else instead

Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

I never thought I'd need a restraining order
But I'm thinking about getting one put on you
Because it ain't cute no more
And every time I turn around, I see your car
Even though you're not invited, still here you are
And that just ain't cool
Why do you keep blowing up my phone
That's why my battery is always dead
I wish that you would just leave me alone
Go give somebody else that head

Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

You make me want to change my number
You make me want to move out of state
Make me want to paint my car a different color
You make me want to get new plates
Make me want to pay 'hood bitches to jump you
You make me want to wear dark shades
You got me trying to hide around corners
I wish you would just go away

Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

Stop calling me, stop texting me
Stop blowing up my phone
Instead of chasing me, you should be erasing me
You ain't getting no more of this bone
Stop stressing me you S-T-A-L-K-E-R
You're a stalker, and you're taking it a little too far

Life goes on in the streets of my hood when you die
But some cry and gets by, while others choose to wonder why
His life was took at such an early age
A young nigga who lived in a rage died by the gage

He used to hustle on the street corners
His mom would always beg him to quit but he didn't wanna
As he got older, he got even worse
'Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse

A cold night in his hood, he had a tangle
The brother he was squabblin' with, had broke his ankle
Laid him out in the driveway
Some people knew he wouldn't survive but hey

I ain't the one to speak up on another's
All I can do is try to open his eyes and help the brother
He chose the wrong way and that's the route he took
Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook

He had a baby that he couldn't raise
And she will never see her father again 'cause he's in a grave
I always think about 
"My daddy was a dopeman, so I'ma be a dope dealer"

How will the family explain it?
"My daughter had a baby for a 'caine head!"
He ain't around to see her walk
Dry her eyes when she cries, pick her up when she falls

Just the thought of a kid livin' fly fucks me up
When his girl has to raise a bastard child
It gets deeper, he used to punch her and beat her
She was loyal to his ass but accused as a cheater

She had a good deck but she picked the wrong card
Had a kid, now she's realizin' life is hard
A big time dope dealer's all she wanted
Who drove a Jag or a Benz so she could flaunt it

The situation's got me guessin'
But the answer remains to be a question
He lived his life in a lie
I guess you only get a minute to pray, and a second to die

It was crazy how it happened
Some niggaz rolled by in the Riviera cappin'
All I could see was a pistol spittin' rounds
And the boy was just screamin' as he fell to the ground

A woman yelled, get an ambulance
But I knew he was dead, he didn't stand a chance
You shoulda seen him, he was scared
A bullet goes to his chest and one to his head

He just laid there in silence and all I heard was the sirens
Paramedics pulled up
Followed by a law man and then came a firetruck
Put his ass on the stretcher

But if he survives, I'm willin' to betcha
He'll be out for revenge
They patched him up within a week he was back at it again
Went to his brother on the North side

Grab your shit, it's a hit, we're gonna take a long ride
Packed it up in the trunk
AK-47, M-11 and a pump
Rolled by  on Scott Street

School was lettin' out
“Yo, you ain't gonna shoot yet?" "Watch me!"
Opened his trunk and grabbed a shotgun
He shot him

Put his tooly on the front seat
Continued his mission, as he headed down the street
The kids was just starin' at each other
J.D. rolled by and smoked black's brother

Reached in his coat and grabbed a 'port
Full speed down Reed, shot his mom on the porch
On his way down Cullard
His brother was just dazed in a shock, "Why you do it?"

"Why you shot his moms Jay? Shit"
"He, he, he, he, he hah man fuck that bitch"
Went to the store to use the pay phone
Called up Mack, "Aiyyo J.D. Homey"

Hung it up and rolled down Dagger
Headin' for the nigga he was after
By the time he arrived at the scene
Malcolm was ready for anything

He tried to sneak around the back way
Never thought of bein' taken out on that day
Black boy, black coat
Stood around the corner as he passed slit his throat

He didn't fall so he fired
One to the middle of his skull, he's expired
A whole army came out
Twenty-seven niggaz all strapped out of one house

That how it happens in the acre
One nigga died in the park in the paper
Shit gets deeper but why?
I guess you only get a minute to pray and a second to die

One of my partnas have been shot
And all that's going through my mind
Is he dead or alive, when I'm pacing the flo'
And looking around 4-5
Thinking of the worst, but nobody would tell me the drama
But the silence is killing me, checking on his family
Saying a prayer for him and his mama
Come through sit at his bedside, and ease his pain
Relieve my tension, I'm flinching when they mention name
Big D, come G, I don't want you to die
Remember when we use to dip
In your day-day Coupe and get high
Remember, when you use to think I was crazy and wouldn't chill with me
You come to get me up the flip, and smoke some kill with me
I really appreciate the love that was shown
I'ma keep the faith and never leave you alone
You can depend on me, got down on my knees
And I prayed, until you recovered
Then jumped your big ass, right back off in the game
Because there's money to be made, and I won't knock you
Just watch yourself when you in them streets
And keep your heater, under your seat when you creep


And to my G's
Don't worry bout a damn thang


You use to call me G.I., but to me you was s soldier indeed
Even though you dodged the cops daily, you would hit my crib up with weed
Freestyling to beats, and smoking on fire sweet and parlay
You should of got a purple heart, for living in a war everyday
If he's really a friend, you would turn him in
That's what the laws would tell us
And fellas would talk about turning you in
How could your hood be so jealous
And ready to give out the location, of a G on the move
Somebody tell me, is your partna's freedom worth some money to you
But I know he's in the county jail stressed, fuck stabbing you in your back
Cause they smile up in your face, and stab you in your chest
And its kinda hard, to receive the swishas they pass me
When I feel I got to watch the people, they call his still family
Must a song be coming, cause it happened the way you said it would unfold
My name is Grady, and they watch me like the Super Bowl
Now that your not around, I'ma still put it down the way you told me to do
And when I go gold its dedicated to you, and to my G's




I'm still trying to figure out what happened
One minute you here, then the next you was gone
Just think quick, I lost my nigga
Victimized to the game, and we still mourn
But nigga hold on, cause I know its living life
Trapped in this cell, trying to ease the pain
But it still remains, every time I put you in jail
And its hard to accept the fact, that you a cellmate my nigga
Po' out some liquor, and sho' wish was here to light, up this swisha
And I'll never forget the advice you gave me bout life, cause you were right
Don't shake them dikes, cause the rules apply, ain't always precise
I'm paying a price, my freedom been taken away
And they threw away the key, trapped in misery
Cause suffering forced me to run these streets so desperately
And to my G's watch your back, cause it ain't no love in these streets
It seems like each day, there's a different way, to fall victim to defeat
Cause if you real with your boy, it don't hurt to see him fall off
When a forty get low point to the curb, just letting you know you thought of
No matter what when you get out, thangs'll still be the same
But until then hold on nigga, and don't worry bout a damn thang




This world is not my home, I'm just a passing through
My treasures are laid out, somewhere beyond the blue
The angels beckon me, from Heaven's open doors
And a nigga can't feel at home in the this world no mo'
Feel at home in this world no mo'

Only chase money, we ain't chasin' no kitten
But I work that mouth out, drop down gimme fifty
Sippin' black remy, riding in black Porsche's

Tonight they be mine, tomorrow they yours
Loud in my blunt, kick hard like horses

Scared of the hood girl, hell nah
Scared to get high girl, hell nah
On that bitch, scared to ride girl, hell nah
Scared of a fast car, hell nah

You know what's funny
When the shit that makes you laugh, makes you cry
Hell I'm 'bout ready to cry now
Thinking 'bout my cousin Brandon
And how we used to clown
And then I hear them two shots
And seen him hit the ground
I think about Chuck a rapper soon to be a legend
And then I see him lying there bleeding and begging
Now every second is divided up
At .5 I think of Brandon .5 of Chuck
And it's fucked up 'cause, chuck died on my birthday
I'm celebrating 19 in the worse way
All I can say is that it's been about a year now
365 days of asking how, and still no answers


We want some answers 
I done had to cry so much that it's funny now
Dropping tears think its water balloons asking how
Could this be me, I couldn't see that better way
I'm just another black product of where I stay
Living hell, everybody I know sells or at least tried
To buy the plastic for black mail, see how they lied
I'm denied for everything, I quite applying
I can't even hear the birds sing, my partner's crying
I often see my brother lying, up in his bunk
Writing letters from jail telling me to keep it crunk
Label a drunk to my thirst quencher, a case of Bud
Got me looking at the bottle backward, letter switcher
No matter I'ma continue my journey, where was I headed
A challenge boy every second, damn I regret it
More regular than unleaded
Irregular mother, the baby and the child's father
Must be that each other, another child like most
Ain't no love, 'cause from the east to the West Coast
Baby thugs, they selling drugs fuck a pacifier
So why the fuck should I be scared of eternal fire
I want some motherfucking answers

Only thing that's on my mind 
Is who's gonna run this town tonight 
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds, ridin' with they Dillingers
I'd get more in depth, if you boys really real enough
This is la familia, I'll explain later
But for now let me get back to this paper, I'm a couple bands down
And I'm tryin' to get back
I gave the other grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma's, six zeros, dot zeroes here it go,
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas, now we squared up, hold up
Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain 
Victory's within the mile,
Almost there, don't give up now 
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, heyy

On the tape we're screamin' fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquet for the broads, they got a table for of fellas
And they ain't spending no cake

'Cause they ain't got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my banquette is looking like millionaires' row
Life's a game but it's not fair

To everybody on your dick, no homo

Next time I'm in church, please no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fucking Rav-4?
But I know that if I stay stun-ting
All these girls only gonna want one thing
I could spend my whole life good will hunting
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm coming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting, off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
I'm just trying to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to drop some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?

Who shot ya? Separate the weak from the obsolete
Hard to creep them Brooklyn streets
It's on nigga, fuck all that bickering beef
I can hear sweat trickling down your cheek
Your heartbeat sound like Sasquatch feet
Thundering, shaking the concrete
Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school/new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn like "Disco Inferno"
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Niggas know: the lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with B.I.G. it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules
Everything around me two Glock 9s
Any motherfucker whispering about mines
And I'm Crooklyn's finest
You rewind this, Bad Boy's behind this

Stack mad chips, spread love with my peeps
Niggas wanna creep, gotta watch my back
Think the Cognac and indo sack make me slack?
I switches all that, cocksucker G's up
One false move, get Swiss cheesed up
Clip to TEC, respect I demand it
Slip and break the 11th Commandment
Thou shalt not fuck with nor see Poppa
Feel a thousand deaths when I drop ya
I feel for you, like Chaka Khan I'm the don
Pussy when I want, Rolex on the arm
You'll die slow but calm
Recognize my face, so there won't be no mistake
So you know where to tell Jake, lame nigga
Brave nigga, turned front page nigga
Puff Daddy flips daily
I smoke the blunts he sips on the Baileys
On the rocks, tote Glocks at christenings
Hammer cock, in the fire position and...

Come here, come here, 
Open your fucking mouth, open your—didn't I tell you?
Don't fuck with me? 
Huh? Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me? 
Look at you now, huh?

And all that ever took was patience

At times I thought we'd never make it

And 'til I'm laid to rest we lay, yeah
'Til the time bein', we lit
Hopin' I don't let it get all in my head
I don't need the money just to say that I'm rich
Couple little honeys wanna get in my bed
But they used to run from me when I had nothin'
Now they want to fuck 'cause they see me stuntin'
Nigga came up off the hustlin'
Livin' in the lap of lux and I'm feelin' like the man
If you ain't in my Chucks, then you wouldn't understand
Homie, 'bout these rubberbands on me
Make her wanna dance for me
Prolly leave her man for me, standin' in the stands, goddamn


I used to feel so devastated

And all that ever took was patience
I-I-I used to feel so devastated 
At times I thought we'd never make it 
But now we on our way to greatness 
And all that ever took was patience 

I put my pain on the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes
I put my pain in the cadence
Turn my brain up a wavelength
Now we're flowin' and sailin'
So just go with the feelin'
Baby, soak up the vibe
Let's roll some dope up, get high
We gon' blow smoke in the sky
'Til we can't open our eyes, yeah

Oh, no

Niggaz wanna try, niggaz wanna lie
Then niggaz wonder why, niggaz wanna die
All I know is pain
All I feel is rain
How can I maintain, with madd shit on my brain
I resort to violence, my niggaz move in silence
Like you don't know what our style is
New York niggaz the wildest
My niggaz is wit' it
You want it? come and get it
Took it then we split it
You fuckin' right we did it
What the fuck you gonna do, when we run up on you
fuckin' wit' the wrong crew, don't know what we goin' thru
I'ma have ta show niggaz how easily we blow niggaz
When you find out there's some more niggas, that's runnin with your niggaz
Nothin' we can't handle, break it up and dismantle, light it up like a candle
just cause I can't stand you
Put my shit on tapes, like you bussin' grapes
Think you holdin weight? Then you haven't met the Apes
Is ya'll niggaz crazy?
I'll buss you and be swazy
Stop actin' like a baby, mind your business lady
Nosy people get it too, when you see me spit at you

Ya I know it's pitiful
That's how niggaz get down
Watch my niggaz spit round
Make ya'll niggaz kiss ground, just for talkin' shit clown
Oh you think it's funny then you don't know me money

It's about to get ugly, fuck it dog I'm hungry
I guess you know what that mean, come up off that green
Five niggaz or a fiend, don't make it a murder scene
Give a dog a bone, leave a dog alone
Let a dog roam and he'll find his way home
Home of the brave, my home is a cage
and yo I'ma slave til' my home is the grave
I'ma pull capers, it's all about the papers
Bitches talkin' paper then how they wanna rape us
Look what you dun started
Asked for it, you got it
Had it, should have shot it

Now your dearly departed
Get at me dog, did I rip shit with this one here I flip shit
Niggaz know when I kick shit
It's gonna be some slick shit
What was that look for, when I walked in the door
Oh you thought you was raw, boom not anymore
Cause now you on the floor, wishin you never saw me walk
through that door, with that 4 4
Now it's time for bed
Two more to the head, got the floor red
Yea that nigga's dead
Another unsolved mystery, It's goin' down in history
Niggaz ain't never did shit to me

Bitch ass niggaz can't get to me

Got a make'em grove, got'em all like ooh

Down the chimney, he will come
With his great big smile
And you'll find that even the kiddies
Are swingin' in the latest style
Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringing?
Oh, oh, oh
I wonder whether he'll be swingin'

It feels so good it should cost
Bought an alligator, I ain't talkin' Lacoste
Made me say, "ooh, uh"
Like I'm mixing Master P and Rick Ross 
She seem to make me always feel like a boss 
She said I'm in the wrong hole, I said I'm lost 
She said I'm going too fast, I'm exhausted
Now drop to your knees for the offerin'
This the theme song, oh something wrong
Might need an intervention for this new dimension
That's too new to mention, or fit in a sentence
If I get locked up, I won't finish the sent-

Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh
I wonder whether he'll be swingin'

Gettin' loose while I'm on the deuce, see me roll out
What you surfin' the coast, and I spend it, I got
Plenty of bitches for the evening, we could journey we off
For the light that guide us home, we in the moment, oh-oh
Such a lost boy, caught up in the darkest I had
What's the cost, boy? Losing everything that I had
She been on me, boy, unless you got something to tell
Sittin', waitin' for me slippin', yeah, I'll see you in hell
Tell the cougar get up off me, no, my soul ain't for sale
All the evils in the world, they keepin' on me for real
I really hope the Lord won't hurt me, we all live in sin
Kids see ghost off the ropes, Ric Flair on your bitch
Now this the theme song, this the theme song
The put the beams on, get your, get your dream on
But you don't hear me though, drama:  we let it go
Watch the guitars roll and let your friends know

Oh, oh, oh
What is Santa bringin'?
Oh, oh, oh
I wonder whether he'll be swingin'

Just do that and then let the music do something,
then do that again, that'd be enough for a record
I mean, you only want two and a half minutes
if you can get it, you know, three minutes max—

Ooooh, New York!
Ooooh, New York!

Grew up in a town that is famous as a place of movie scenes
Noise is always loud, there are sirens all around and the streets are mean
If I can make it here, I can make it anywhere, that's what they say
Seeing my face in lights or my name in marquees found down on Broadway

Even if it ain't all it seems, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!

On the avenue, there ain't never a curfew, ladies work so hard
Such a melting pot, on the corner selling rock, preachers pray to God
Hail a gypsy cab, takes me down from Harlem to the Brooklyn Bridge
Some will sleep tonight with a hunger for more than an empty fridge

I'ma make it by any means, I got a pocketful of dreams
Baby I'm from New York!
Concrete jungle where dreams are made of
There's nothing you can't do
Now you're in New York!
These streets will make you feel brand new
Big lights will inspire you
Hear it for New York, New York, New Yooork!

One hand in the air for the big city
Street lights, big dreams, all looking pretty
No place in the world that can compare
Put your lighters in the air, everybody say
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

Where would I be without my baby 
The thought alone might break me 
And I don't wanna go crazy
Cuz every thug needs a lady


Girl it feel like you and I been mourning together
Inseparable, we chose pain over pleasure
For that you'll forever be a part of me
Mind body and soul ain't no I in we baby

When you cry who wipes yo tears 
When you scared, who's tellin you there's nothin to fear

Girl I'll always be there
When you need a shoulder to lean on

Never hesitate knowin' you can call on, your soul-mate
And vice versa, dats why I be the firsta
See Jacob and frost your wrist up
Now you owe me, I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me
Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Yo, and I appreciate the rocks
and gifts that you cop me baby 
And that house on the hill when you drop like 80 
On a down payment thinking damn ain't life gravy
And ever since for my honey I been twice the lady
What would I do without the nights that you kept me warm

When this cold world had a girl caught in a storm
And I accept when you riff when you caught in the wrong
And respect when you flip, 'cause our love is strong
And when you hit the block, I watch for 10-4
And when my pops asleep you snuck in the backdoor
Baby boy we been down since junior high
So when life get as hot July it's the world against you and I
We ballin', tied together and ever
Heart from the heart, knew that it would last forever
When you told me, you would never leave me lonely 
So baby boy put it on me

Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Since we met it's been you and I
A tear for a tear, baby eye for an eye
And you know that my heart gone cry
If you leave me lonely
Cuz you not just my love you my homie
Who's gonna console me, my love
I'm outta control hold me, my love
Cause I'm yours
And I don't wanna do nothin to hurt my baby girl 
If this was our world it would be all yours baby
the thought alone might break me
and i dont wanna go crazy
coz every thug needs a lady

ah, forgive you baby cuz thoughs eyes aint lyin
wash away all the tears baby no more cryin 
baby, and you complete me
and i would die if you aint with me
so baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me
Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
I only think about you

I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me
Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me
Where would I be without you
I only think about you
I know you're tired of being lonely
So baby girl put it on me

Yeah. sendin this one out. to my man Killa B
No doubt indeed. without weed. knowhatI'msayin?
That old real shit.

There's a war goin on outside no man is safe from
You could run but you can't hide forever
from these streets that we done took
You walkin witcha head down scared to look
You scause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cop's control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin to bag me and get rocked steady
by the mac one-double, I touch you
and leave you with not much to go home wit
My skin is thick, cause I be up in the mix of action
if I'm not at home, puffin lye relaxin
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul, before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
And to the drama I built, and all unfinished beef
You will soon be killed, put us together
It's like mixin vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin, takin my enemies with me
and if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord forgive me the Hennesey got me not knowin how to act
I'm fallin and I can't turn back
or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
that I can't say so it's left a untold fact, until my death
My goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

Mobb Deep

Yo, yo
We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

We livin this til the day that we die


Survival of the fit only the strong survive


I'm trapped, in between two worlds, tryin to get dough y'know
When the dough get low the jewels go, but never that
As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin countin my stacks
No doubt, watchin my back and proceed with caution
Five-oh lurkin, no time to get lost in -- the system
Niggaz usin fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I-llegal world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin when he got bagged, that fucked me up God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're upstate bleedin
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid witchu
Hit wit a 2 to 4 it's difficult
Wild on the streets I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, cause hoes like to run game
Some niggaz like to trick but I ain't wit that trickin shit
I'm like a Jew, savin dough so I can big whip
Pushin a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get I'm stayin in the projects, forever
Jakes on the blocks we out-clever
If beef, we never seperate and pull together
When worse comes to worse and my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin cute, I'm strictly Timb boots and army certified suits
Puffin L's, laid back, enjoyin the smell

In the Bridge gettin down it ain't hard to tell

You better realize

Mobb Deep

We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive

We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive


We livin this til the day that we die
Survival of the fit only the strong survive


Look in the eyes and get wise
Look alive, in ninety-five, word up
Hypnotic thug life, get that ass paralyzed
Knahmsayin? Mobb Deep and all that

Author: Joey Bada$$

Yeah
You know sometimes I don't think they truly understand me you know, 'cause they don't

Can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, Two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawned out the nebula
And everything I do or say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire actions in your first child
I'll begin my verse now

Sometimes I speak and I feel like it ain't my words
Like I'm just a vessel channeling inside this universe
I feel my ancestors unrested inside of me
It's like they want me to shoot my chance in changing society
But how do I go about it? Tell me where I start?
My destiny rerouted when I chose to follow heart
You told to follow suit, but tell me what it do for you?
Except weigh you down, now you trapped inside the cubicle they built for us
The first step into change is to take notice
Realize the real games that they tried to show us
300 plus years of them cold shoulders
Yet 300 million of us still got no focus
Sorry America, but I will not be your soldier
Obama just wasn't enough, I just need some more closure
And Donald Trump is not equipped to take this country over
Let's face facts 'cause we know what's the real motives

And the land of the free is full of free loaders
Leave us dead in the street to be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last names of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners

Can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, Two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula
And everything I do is and say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action

Trickery in the system, put my niggas in prison
All our history hidden, ain't no liberty given
We all fit the description of what the documents written
We been lacking the vision and barely making a living
We too worried to fit in while they been benefitin'
Every time you submittin', we all guilty admit it
The lord won't get you acquitted, but you still ask for forgiveness
Put opiates in syringes then inject his religion
How many times do I gotta tell you I'm a man on a mission
Many times I gotta tell you I don't need no permission
A human with super vision, ain't no livin' condition
I'm reaching out to my children, just hoping that they will listen
Start a new coalition against corrupt politicians
It's not enough pots to piss in, too many murder convictions
Another family evicted, another black man a victim
That's as real as it's getting, you should take recognition

In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners
Still got the last name of our slave owners
In the land of the free, it's for the free loaders
Leave us dead in the street then be your organ donors
They disorganized my people, made us all loners

Can't change the world unless we change ourselves
Die from the sicknesses if we don't seek the health
All eyes be my witness when I speak what's felt
Full house on my hands, the cards I was dealt
Three K's, Two A's in AmeriKKKa
I'm just a black spade spawn out the nebula
And everything I do is and say today is worthwhile
Will for sure inspire action in your first child

Locked down 24, no more Phillippe steak
Damn, shit's so real it seems fake
Damn, let me take 'em to the green gate
When we was sellin' white girl

These niggas dick ride like they don't even like girls
A hundred thousand for the jet, yeah that's the flight bill
Damn, cost four bricks to go to the LIV nigga
Whole squad on some shit, that's how we live nigga
Twenty-five bad bitches what we did nigga
That's fifty different Louboutins bleedin' red nigga
Whew, I ain't blood and I ain't crippin' neither
On the phone with the plug talkin' Justin Bieber
I made milly last week and I ain't touch it neither
Straight cash tryna give 'em straight gas
Catch you out in Brooklyn, get your chain tookin'
My Philly boys'll creep up on you when you ain't lookin'
With your lil memes, I be with the real queen
Screamin' free the real Preme, we be doin' real things
Pull up with a bad bitch, whippin' somethin' real mean
Marchin' all these fuckin' drums on me like a drill team
I be with my young niggas, all they know is kill things
Don't make me make a real scene, uh
See an OVO chain, probably take that shit
Said dreamin' wasn't enough, we had to chase that shit
You ain't write it' nigga, we caught ya, can't erase that shit
And you claimin' you HOV now? Why you state that shit?
Man I hate that shit, niggas be talkin' out they face
But soon as you body somethin' they be singin' like they Drake
Wait, niggas dancin' like they fruitcakes
Hotline Bling, don't get no bing up in this new Wraith
Pull up on the plug, swap that bag with the suitcase
DC4 on the way, that's nigga's due date
Robbed you in your city and you told
Tory from the 6, you hatin' on him, Lord knows
Culture vulture, now it's time to pay the tolls
Soft as the lacrosse team, boy that's word to HOV
No reply, word to God I'm on the floor still
Me and Nicki watchin' the Sixers, I'm closin' more deals
Dream chasin' double MG, we got the door sealed
Roc Nation, Atlantic Records, I'm on my fourth deal
When I met you, you was on my dick
Asked me to hold the DC chain, now you on some shit

Fuckboy, huh charge you triple the way this real nigga stamp. Chasers, ahh. Location: Philly; Mood: Glock with 30; Status: triple OG, never been disrespected without retaliation, chump

I've been in the hood for like a year straight
Sippin' dirty, it be hard for me to stare straight
Damn, it's time to cut the dead weight
I'm tryna turn my CLS into a red Wraith
When I was sellin' hard crack you was scared straight
I dropped 9 and bought the Rollie with the red face
Meek the one that got the mil, the one that got the deal
I'm still lampin' with the shooters and they poppin' pills
These niggas like to rap diss they get popped for real
It's time to son these pussy rappers, I'm their pop for real
I'm the type to fuck your mom cause she's a thot for real
And I ain't got one, my pump playin' shotgun
Quarterback that Glock, Cam Newton, and you catch a hot one
And for the fam I'll keep shootin' until the cops come
Reload, double back, hold up cuz, I got one
Official only respect official and you are not one
No, we are not them, we be on some other shit
Deep in them trenches, duckin' narcotics and the government
Tracin' the dollar, flippin' that product, tryna double shit
Chewing like it's double mint
Man, who you niggas fuckin' with?

Hah, hey Meek Mill man, I'ma start running down on these niggas too. Real rap, these niggas soft and they frauds, check DC record nigga, we flawless.

Throw your hands in the air right now, man
Feel this shit right here
Scott Storch, nigga
Yeah, Khaled I see you, nigga
Show Big Pun love, yeah

I don't give a fuck 'bout your fault or mishaps, nigga
We from the Bronx, New York, shit happens
Kids clappin', love to spark the place
Half the niggas in the squad, got a scar on their faces

It's a cold world and this is ice
Half a mil' for the charm, nigga, this is life
Got the Phantom in front of the building, Trinity Ave
Ten years been legit, they still figure me bad

As a young'n, it was too much to cope with
Why you think, mo'fuckers nick named me, Cook Coke Shit
Should've been called Don Robbery
Extortion, or maybe Grand Larceny

I did it all, I put the pieces to the puzzle
This long, I knew me and my peoples was gone bubble
Came out the gate on some flow Joe shit
Fat nigga with the shoty was the logo, kid

Said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and
Do the rock away 
Now lean back, lean back )
Lean back, lean back, come on
I said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and
Do the rock away 
Now lean back, lean back 
Lean back, lean back, come on

R to the eezy, M to the whizzah
My arms stay breezy, the don's stay fizzah
I got a date at eight, I'm in a seven forty fizzive
And I just bought a bike so I can ride till I die

With a matchin' jacket 'bout to cop me a mansion
My niggas in the club, but you know they not dancin'
We gangsta, and gangstas don't dance or boogie
So never mind how we got in here with burners and hoodies

Listen, we don't pay admission and bouncers don't check us
And we walk around the metal detectors
And there really ain't a need for a VIP section
In the middle of the dance floor reckless, check it

Said he like my necklace, started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
See, money ain't a thing, nigga, we still the same, nigga
Flows just changed now we 'bout to change the game, nigga

Said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and
Do the rock away 
Now lean back, lean back )
Lean back, lean back, come on
I said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and
Do the rock away 
Now lean back, lean back 
Lean back, lean back, come on

Now we livin' better now, Gucci sweater now
And that G4 could fly through any weather now
See, niggas get tight when you worth some millions
That's why I sport this chinchilla to hurt their feelings

You can find Joe Crack at all type of shit
Out at Vegas, front row to all the fights and shit
If I woulda brought Compton, then they'd prolly squeal
'Cause half these rappers, they blow like Derek Foreal

If you cross the line, damn right, I'm gon' hurt you
These faggot niggas even made gang signs commercials
Even Lil' Bow Wow throwin' it up
B2K crip walkin' like that's what's up

Kay keep tellin' me to speak about the rucker
Matter of fact, I don't wanna speak about the rucker
Not even Pee Wee Kirkland could imagine this
My niggas didn't have to play to win the championship


Niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and
Do the rock away 
Now lean back, lean back )
Lean back, lean back
Come on
I said my niggas don't dance, we just pull up our pants and
Do the rock away

Look, I love her curves but what's more preferred
Is the way she articulates words
Can't help observe and stare
When she in the mirror
Masking the massacre while she fixing her hair
I mean she so perfect
In her own little world
We built the foundation, everything I want in a girl
And it's a matter of time until her last name mine
You got potential baby, just imagine us combined
I wanna see you shine like the gem that you are
Want you be so secure that they can see from afar
That you don't need another man
And you can stand on your own
Let's keep stacking your bread
And one day we gonna get gone
And get, away from here
You're the only reason I be, staying here
Wanna paint a picture, let's make it clear
The future so bright baby, race you there

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling

Love is only a feeling

Girl you talk too much, need to relax
No stress please, just please roll us a fat
Blunt so we can smoke, and fill the room with love
You buzz 'cause I'm feeling the groove with this one
Come take you a sip, let's dance under the moon
They way that it's lit, got me feelin' the mood
To vibe and be tuned, I'm so into you
Let's lose track of the night and stay up til it's noon
Watch the sun rise and watch the moon fall
Let's leave a few wheels, surprised when you spawn
Back from the world of infinite beyond
Roll your eyes back and let's keep on going
Come take a ride, I'll be your chauffeur
I wanna make you sing to me as your toes curl

I love it when she doing all the things I showed her
I think our love formin' that's what I owe her

Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling
Love is only a feeling

¿Como estás, papi? Muy bien
I'll be on el avión while you prolly home
And you still fuck around with them maricóns
Young Gustavo, smoke Cubanos, out in Cabo with the next top model
Feelin' like a nigga just hit the lotto

Plus she loyal, suck and swallow

That pussy worth to make a fly solo

Better get your man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal

Homie this my story

First things first, uh, shoutout to the sponsors
Everything I do I do it big, I'm a monster
The kid from West Brooklyn, came with the thunder
Every day another triple-double entendre
At times I sit and wonder how I keep from going under
But I always beat the clock like Kyrie Irving at the buzzer
Looking in the crowd, at the audience they love us
Got a team of warriors nobody ranked above us
And I got love for my brothers keep the chemistry strong
We gon' be up for a while like keep the legacy goin'
The most valuable Pro heading straight for the throne
I'm in a lane of my own, two-three when I get in my zone
Even when I'm OT man I still feel at home
The G-O-A-T when it's all said and done
They only make legends where I'm from
Been known we won before the song begun

And this feels like a victory

And even if they still wheelchair him in the end
'Til his last stand, swear I got love for my fans
Back by popular demand, I'm the man
All I do is win I feel like a highlight reel
I put numbers on the board even scores up the floor for real
I do it just for sport
Like the homies with the rock in the white tube socks
Word is bond, I am the one
I got it locked, up in the cluster, pressure on
Back on the block, I call the shots
You sit and watch when I'm against the clock I make the world stop
Hold up, but let's get back to business please
I'ma be up for a while I know you sick of me
Y'all ain't real ballers, y'all just little leagues
And we ain't taking no losses we the winning team, East

Author: Nyck Caution feat. Joey Bada$$

I run around through the night like I'm nocturnal
Running raw through the wife when she not fertile
Everybody in my high school, shitting on me rapping
Wished we would've swapped journals
I am not the flop, I learned that when the block was hot
And Lil Wayne got me thinking that I got this
A little pain gonna happen in the process
But a little change gonna happen after all that
Now I'm thinking back like I once did
Back when I thought I could run shit
Summer camp getting higher than bunk beds
Summer plans getting fly for the function
You know that I was getting by as a young kid
Back when everything was blissful
Back when everything was so simple
But everything don't last forever
I break bread with the fans, bring cats together
Little different than my last direction
But the flow is like a blast Beretta
A couple shots, put him down like an anesthetic
And now you way too fast to get up
About time Nyck told y'all that
About time, Nyck cold and the world know that
If you see me around the block I don't owe you daps
World class in my verse, you can hold your glass
Cause we good

Ya'll know the name
I said what's understood
Don't gotta be explained
Met-Metro, Metro Boomin want some more
Went to school ain't wanna go
So I started dropping out
And instead I hit that road
Now this life is all I fucking know
You took a shot
You missed and can't reload
Boy I swear to god, I took this to my grave
What's understood don't gotta be explained

I don't wanna know if you gotta go
I don't wanna know if you gotta go
I don't wanna know if you gotta go
I don't wanna know

Back in the booth on my boss shit
It's a new year, I'm on my boss shit
Got the news, they need more shit
Dropped my debut, been on tour since
Tell the truth, man I really hate to dispute
Name another yout that really did it on his own
No majors, no cosign at all
Just labor and raising the bar
Still ain't enough to get invited to awards
Like I still ain't get a nut and I've been going this hard
Fuck it I'ma pull up to awards with the squad
Slamming the door, shooting up stars
Who want war bet they don't want none
Who, what, when, where, why, go run
Catch a motherfucker like Ricky with his gun
With a .22 bitch, ain't 22 yet
Everyday trying to live, Russian roulette
Just turned 21, I be forever young
I be the greatest one, he told me to my face
Patience is key, you gonna be straight
How many times you gonna be late?
Miss my chance? Oh no, not me
Shift my stance and go the right way
Took one glance and saw the right thing
I could give a fuck what they say about me
They ain't making nothing, they ain't taking my cheese
I ain't gotta forfeit, I done get those hoes to leave
To the water, don't you order take a motherfucking drink
Guess eyes roll cause they more like sheep
There's stress in the belly of the beast
For generation X, to generation Y, to generation Z-Z-Z
Y'all niggas is sleep
And I pray that they're ready when the war time
In the belly of the beast with the pork rinds
Barely in the street, nigga fuck 12
Seen the cameras on me when I touched down
Feds watching, please believe it
Don't share my business with social media
Niggas devious, they can't eat with us
Went around starting fake beef with us
And this life

Is all I fucking know
You took a shot
You missed and can't reload
Boy I swear to god, I took this to my grave
What's understood, don't gotta be explained

I don't wanna know if you gotta go
I don't wanna know if you gotta go
I don't wanna know if you gotta go
I don't wanna know

Badmon representing
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
They ain't really ready they ain't never ready
I was born ready now I'm coming heavy
Now I'm coming heavy


I hope you ready, cause its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house


Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping
They forgot we from the bottom
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar
Before the money and the power
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking
They got me mistaken
Critics try to box me
I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze
I'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see
Cause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels
Temper rising cools prolly see me on the news
Joey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose
Now while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too
I'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York
I'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long
So if you trying to score just pass it to me more
Never dropping the ball, always raising the bar


Man it's gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
All these others niggas thinking they from the south


Bitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it
Though I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it
You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger
How can you sign if you know your tryna beat a nigga
When I made it to his office I was seventeen
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings
In that moment man I knew I could do anything
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me
60k first week for the Badass
200k to this day I know you niggas mad
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next
Got these niggas bread hurt lil' biscuit
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck
Got the ninjas on deck and the bitches in check
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you
Steezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you
I see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too
And if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you

Man its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
Tell these other niggas I'm coming for the crown

Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready, bitch

We done came up
Everybody love 'em
On the regular


Lookin' at popular colored faces
Observing what my brothers faces in all races
Lost in generations before hatred
See with your eyes dilated for the sake of the Gs
But keep it sacred G, f*ck a rat race, we take the cheese
Jack cheddar from the make believe
Break the trees on they eighth CD
Rocking the red and black lumberjack faithfully
I'm a Brooklyn n*gga, basically I grind with the grimiest
Learn how to eat in the jungle full of hyenas
And vultures, don't worry what a verse will cost ya
From the young scorcher, just remember who taught ya
I'm gonna spark it off unorthodox
Won't sign to no major if no wager
Less than a 3 million offer off the top
I'll be in a box with my coughin' drops
Why settle for a office spot?
N*ggas don't always make it off the block
Unless they extort rocks or support the cops
They still snitchin' - let me guess: that's your mannequin?
Leave 'em shook while you're standing and quit the shenanigans
Have you panicking, induce damages 'til you're vanishing
Words or tour probably resort top sea examinin'
This is for my real hip hop fans and 'em
I dispose for 'em, leave fake MC's in the post mortem


Cause money ain't a thing if I got it I won't spend
All I got is my Pros, I don't need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won't sin
No he won't give in
Yo this world is bone chillin'
Make meals in hell's kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered, drop trees in my swishers,
And bring that back to my property wit' ya


It ain't easy being this royal
When you got this much going for you
It ain't hard to be disloyal
Comin' straight from the soil with lines that never coil
Start to think pretty off new career with this spoil
The kid is that sick so expect more coffins
I'm the chosen one so you can expect more offerings
I be sonning n*ggas so expect less offerings
Best rapper alive hear that line used less often
Word to God I'm the best offering
BMX like Hoffman
BMF like Ross man
Young boss, man, got Jimmy Fallon endorsements
From porches, to Porsches, getting portions of fortune
They said next up so I stepped up
Fly like I dressed up
B*tches try to hang like left nuts
Like orangutans in the west of
Of the mother land, but I've got the swank of no other man
Brother man
They can't understand
Pro Era boys pop rubber band


Cause money ain't a thing if I got it I won't spend
All I got is my Pros, I don't need no friends
Feel like this glory road is coming to an end
The only soul that won't sin
No he won't give in
Yo this world is bone chillin'
Make meals in hell's kitchen with these dishes
Properly delivered, drop trees in my swishers,
And bring that back to my property wit' ya


Everybody love 'em
We done came up
I'ma spark it off unorthodox
They don't feel the name, but they say the music dope though
I'ma spark it off unorthodox
On the regular

Wicked, wicked, now it's on

I murder your whole city, nigga like Frank Nitty hideous, insidious
Niggas betta give me respect when I flex, comin' Tech flows like amphibians
From here to the Carribeans
Unexplored territories like Venus
Niggas never seen the teen the teams keenest
Impairing your mind like Zimas
Infrared beamers, keep your posse on my penis

Now it's on
Wicked's in this, the link a Mid to West flex, the abyss
To this bitch who diss this clique
Bliss is hanging that bitch by the clitoris
You get spit on, shit on, hit on, get on, the dick of this
Slick niggara
But you can always call the Nina
A killer in America, Amerikilla

I got skills to kill like overdosing pills
Blood spills for million dollar bills
You can't try to peel this or feel the illness of a nigga that's coming out real
I don't know why nigga you living a lie
And plus I despise those who try
A nigga like I, this high and fly and sly
Midwestside, so you just might die

Check it out
I murder these hoes, Hercules flows
My shit carries on like Hepatitis
The weak bite us, mean nothing to me
Give me no fuckery foul like 
Nongonococcal urethritis
I might just, make a nigga bite dust
When I bust plus, calamity feels great
Can it be ill?
Yes, sanity kills a real nigga but still
I'm wicked like Amityville
The best: the N9ne? Correct
Burn, now it's your turn
You must learn
Misery niggas are crazed like 24 gang niggas on Sherm
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Tell these punk muthafuckas to leave me alone
When I'm in the zone, you get blown away
Get the clones away, Mitch Bade nigga cause it's on today

Now it's on, now it's on
Now it's on, now it's on, now it's on

Now let me smoke and choke, let these niggas know
That Lejo ain't brought no jokes
Nigga better learn the ropes, we're like costra nostra
And'll fuck around and cut yo' throat
Decapitation facing devastation nations when they raging can't stop this
Nigga you can catch a fist, and you can rest in piss
But the diss and you thought I missed
I'm indestructible and untouchable
Ain't giving a fuck about what you know
I don't love no ho, I don't mug no mo'
But I'm still collecting my other dough
Now peep the rawness, my rhymes are flawless
Fools get tossed for trying to floss like bosses
People can call this the clique with no losses
Cause a nigga can flow from September to August
Deeper than seven seas, colder than no degrees
Niggas is easy to get down on your knees
When you fucking with rhymes like these, I always find that he's
Biting my shit it's me he's trying to be
No more chances, understand this
I'm the man with the plan I stand from Kansas, and this
Weed enhances scandalous dances
What is in my hands will take your last glances
Fucking with a technicality
That's what it gotta be, nigga sitting on the side of me
My mentality makes fatality reality
Split your anatomy: assault and battery
Niggas pray to God we stop; we won't though
Asking who's on the top, they don't know
But don't no motherfucker in the motherfucking western motherfucking hemisphere really want Joe
Associated with a deadly force
We got codes, deeper than Morse, sounds like
And needle points bullet shoot through a horse
So of course, I'm leaving niggas dead like a corpse

Don't, test me, Beatrice
Another colloquialism I came up with the bitch, deep this twist
People do pitiful shit I do unforgettable hits and niggas submitted Amerikilla did it and got
Aquitted, I flip in a minute I'mma get them relish lips
You can't sell us dips
We getting high off K Bombay
Packing hella heat like Pompeii
Itch-made abay igga-nay anyway
I gets ill when I feel like, gettin biz
You know what that is? I know what that is
When I be ripping everybody know what that is
Rewind, slemet, niet
If anybody wanna catch this
I just said, "Fuck demons" and it got bent backwards
And that's bomb futuristic attack shit
Match this, takes hella practice
To rips scripts nigga gotta be thorough
I gotta make this shit make sense so I can say, "Made it Ma"
Top of the world
Give me life or give me death
Death becomes the evil like Asmodeus I got a melodious flow
It becomes
Podious changeable, untamable angel
Anghellic, bustin like a Magnum, Tom Selleck
Missouri terror, sick of losing money at Harrah's
Mac assassin like Antonio Banderas
How many niggas you know I bust style
So ambidextrous and I mean I'm buck wild
When it's on I be heated like a hot comb
Like I said in the first zone
Accident prone, but these niggas don't wanna flex with Tech when the heat is on
Nigga, now it's gone

I ain't the social type!
Joey!
Nah mean!
I ain't with all the congregating!
Fuck niggas, hahaha!
It's, It's, It's that 0-9!

Hey yo I can't lie spent a few years trying to under stand why
When, how is it now I'm so anti
Face asked if you've ever seen a man cry
I think before that shit ain't even pan right
So I don't look at rap dudes like you fans might
Rude, its true excuse I got a slant eye
Regard its my security guard that's why
I'm walking around feeling like I can't die
Or I'm feeling like opportunity ran by 
And I'm chasing it  am I facing it
 No past I'm erasing it
I'm an addict got a habitual habit and I don't avoid voids
Good at substitution replacing shit
I'm just trying to find my place with shit
Pacing quick I ain't go no patience with
Niggas dead can't speak they mind
What the fuck they got a mouth for
Me I'm so full of rage so used to being caged
I probably shouldn't be outdoors
Everybody so scared of the truth
Look in my eyes an stare at the truth
They doing interludes and every interview
Talking about there prepared to shoot 
I'm thought fool I'm resort to getting near a booth
They awful what I do to them unlawful
Boss dude ain't got a high up to resort to
Just giving yourself a bad name
Yackidy yack the threats in fact is that lame
You can't tell that axe arranged
Think I'm wearing a bulls eye
Just all them cats got bad aim I'll explain
I'm past real they past phony
Ignore the personal an physical attacks on me
I remain cool relaxed homie
Brand new I ain't got a scratch on me
So what your squad gonna do
Lay a hand on me I'll lay a hollow on you
Change hands stab his pockets run his wallet on thru
Every club in new york nigga bottles on you
Better tell them what reluctance is
I'm controlled by uncontrolled substances
Soon as he thru I'll show him what substance is
Know I'm nicer when I'm toasted I'm only rubbing it in 
You got beat up ignored in school
Signed a deal niggas thought you was cool
Only take one goner to slaughter your crew 
If your resume got deaded today they'd call you a fool 
All them years rapping nothing else happening
You need a new day to day
Old heads in the game with no other way to get paid
Gasping timeout take a break from the play or grab a Gatorade
Bad contract team can't make a trade
Majors fucking you in the ass you gonna stay a slave
Five-Nine in my ear saying hey behave
But shit is fucked up and i blame it on the way it was paved
I chill for the sake of your age
You great live but let me know when that stage get appraised
All in raising the stakes
Swear you and your label should prayeth
Thank God I was placed in this decade by mistake
I don't belong here dad fucked mom in the wrong year
Wrong peers amongst niggas with wrong ears
Wrong advancing funny sounds every songs weird
Wrong fashion its like everybody's gone queer
Be clear I ain't here to be fronting
You can dislike me I ain't here to pretend
Run but you can't hide I can't lie
Told niggas in the first two bars I was anti

Oh!
Leave me running!
Joey!
No wonder, wheres an escape route when you need it?
Talk to 'em!

<|endoftext|>

Author: Joe Budden


Yeah...
Escape Route
Let's go


And the world keeps spinning! 
I feel like the world keeps spinning 
And the world keeps spinning
It's like the world keeps winning
And to spite me the world keep grinning


I ain't trying to bother none
So how I end up bothered son?
Yeah you damn right I'm my father's son
Minus prison, minus over 20 years in the system
But don't take away the wisdom
Holy water won't cleanse him
Hardheaded, won't convince him
A nigga wear pride like it's denim
Fuck? get along with me
I'm alright with everything that's wrong with me
And that's how it's going to be
That opinion is mine, motherfucker, it belong to me
So get mad at it, half beast, half addict
Can halfass it and be better than rap bastards
Black 'matic, give me rheumatism asthmatic
I spit high class acid, I'm positive, now that's magic
I'm trying to change shit like a Panther
Asking the right questions but getting the wrong answers




I could talk about how a nigga trade slugs
Boast about, toasting, what the .38 does
But a nigga seen what happened to the family of J-Hud
So I thank God for every morning I wake up
Wait up!
Confront is if everything's fine?
But my grandmother's dying, and shes 89
Older but her mind about as sharp as mine
If this world were mine I would rewind time
To a time when her heart didn't leak that fluid
She needs surgery, doctors talking stupid
Said "she already lived her life so she can afford to lose it"
Talking like their tools is useless
Ain't that some shit, she gotta approve it
Grandma ready to go, she'd rather them not do it
No matter how much it might hurt me
Another lesson learned, some fights ain't fight worthy
Jersey




I'm waiting on a true revival
I'ma call you a coward if you alive and suicidal 
Either be grateful for everything God said you supposed to get
Or pull the trigger and get over it
Hip Hop's supposed to give, all this weight on my back
But you ain't gotta spot me, I can shoulder it
Life's a rollercoaster, that ride gonna be easy
Why don't you believe me? My parents was high when they conceived me
Say I got a couple control issues
I disagree, I just like to control issues
My train of thought, my state of mind
Is I could change the world one state at a time
With the madness of every hater alive
Got an agenda, I just feel like ya'll should cater to mine
Ideas brilliant, perservere, I'm resilient
Until the world change, I be right here chilling
Nigga

Freight train, freight train going so fast
Freight train, freight train going so fast
Please don't say what train I'm on
and they won't know what route I've gone.
Please don't tell'em what train I'm on
they won't know what route I've gone.

When I'm dead and in my grave
no more good times shall I pray,
Place a stone at my head and feet,
tell the world that I've gone to sleep.
Place a stone at my head and feet,
tell the world that I've gone to sleep.

* - Originally appeared on the Juice sndtrk

Sip the juice cuz I got enough to go around,
And the thought takes place uptown
I grew up on the sidewalk where I learned street talk,
And then taught to hawk New York-
I go to Queens for queens to get the crew from Brooklyn,
Make money in Manhattan and never been tooken,
Go Uptown and the Bronx to boogie down,
Get strong on the Island, recoupe, and lay around.
Time to bulid my juice back up-
Props back up, suckers get smacked up
Don't doubt the clout, you know what I'm about
Knocking niggaz off, knocking niggaz out
Shaking em up, waking em up
Raking em up, breaking em up...
Standing on shaky grounds too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge

Corners' trifling 'cause shorty's here
I get cock-d liffin' forty's of beer;
Here's a sip for the crew that's deceased,
If I get revenge, then they rest in peace.

Somebody's got to suffer, I just might spare one-
And give a brother a fair one!
Stay alert and on "p's".
And I do work with these- like Hercules,
Switch to southpaw, split your right jaw
'Cause I don't like y'all, I'm hype when night fall.
Smooth but I move like an army
Bulletproof down in case brothers try to bomb me,
Putting brothers to rest like Elliot ness
'Cause I don't like stress
Streets ain't a place for innocent bystanders to stand
Nutting's gonna stop the plan
I'll chill like Pacino, kill like DeNiro
Black Gambino, die like a hero
Living on shaky grounds too close to the edge
Let's see if I know the ledge!

Shells lay around on the battleground
Dead bodies are found throughout the town.
Tried to put shame in my game to make a name, I'm a
Put it on a bullet, put it in your brain.
Rip the block like a buckshot,
Who cares where it goes, just keep the casket closed,
No remorse when a life is lost
I paid my dues- paid the cost!
...And my pockets are still fat,
Wherever I'm at, I get the welcome mat.
Even if my crew steep with one deep
I attract attention, people like to peep
So come say hi to the badguy
Don't say goodbye, I don't plan to die!
'Cause I get loose and I got troops
And crazy juice!
In control of many like Ayatollah Khomeini
Hang out wit Smith and Wesson, don't try to play me.
I'm at war alot, like Anwar Sadat.
But no warning shot, my gun is warm alot.
When I cook beef, the smoke will never clear,
Areas in fear but this here's a fear!
Living life too close to the edge
Hoping that I know the ledge...

A brand new morn, no time to yawn
Shower's on, power's on
Late for school, I catch the train
Girls sip "Cristal" and whisper my name
I push up like an exercise,
Check the intellect and inspect the thighs
Select the best one, pull her to the side
Keep her occupied for the rest of the ride
Read my resume she's know I'm 'ready cool
Just meet me after school,
We can moan and groan until your mom come home,
And you be calling me Al "dope" Capone.
Sweatin' me, she didn't want to let me loose-
Come get me, that's if you want to sip the juice
Cause the streets await me, so I take my gun off safety
Cause alot of niggaz hate me
Coming out of the building, they set me up
Sprayed wit automatics, they wet me up
In a puddle of blood, I lay close to the edge
I guess I didn't know the ledge...

Trigger too, even Nas, I be diggin' too
Let's see whose left Mobb Deep, oh yeah Meth
That brother's hot like curry, one love to Keith Murray

Rappers like Craig Mack quench my thirst for comedy
I'd love to hang with Red Man but I ain't messin' with that bam bazee
The Brat, Lil' Kim, Foxy get that loochee
Especially that cutie representin' for the Fugees, go girls

Even the NBA make rap dollars
Shaquille, Chris Webber, Cedric Ceballos
Talent's around the world, Phoenix to Providence
No need to educate Chicago, they already got Common Sense

Houston and Atlanta, we love you
Peace to the West Coast, they really set the Doggs loose
We always say the future's in today's children
If so, make sure Shyheim and A + sell a million

Peace to Eazy E, Stretch and Mercury
Tupac and Buffy, Notorious B.I.G.
We gots to strive to make hip hop survive
Brothers need to unify to keep the game alive

Rappers be comin' out with one album, then they gone
So with cats like Raekwon, support? em so they stay on
Then brothers like Smooth wouldn't have to hustle
It's an every day struggle, but hip hop I still love you

We Entaprizin', got the hip hop heads realizin'
East Coast, West Coast organizin'
Steady risin', money sizin'
What we specialize in

We Entaprizin', got the hip hop heads realizin'
East Coast, West Coast organizin'
Steady risin', money sizin'
What we specialize in

The fame in the rap game, we all want it
In fact by now I hope the Luniz got a hundred on it
And if you're in it for the millions, E-40
I hope you see 40, before you be 40

What it look like, the great paper chase for ends
Lost Boyz bein' found in Lex Coupes, Beamers and Benz
East Coast, West Coast unite, let's keep it tight
And everythin's gonna be alright

But hold up, it seems we got some hip hop cheats
Dependin' on just havin' catchy hooks and beats
Rappers usin' their skills, recently I haven't heard of none
Me, I represent myself better than Collin Ferguson

And yes, that I do, I'll shatter you
It don't even matter who, I'll make them all show gratitude
Fools actin' like they don't know the rules
Need to learn to listen when grown folks is droppin' jewels

Now they say, is Mr. Kane comin' back to dominate
I used to listen to his music back in 1988
Damn, he still pumpin', just when you think he ain't nothin'
That kid just keep comin' back
What, is he the Terminator or somethin?

Lord, I skill it in a way to make you feel it
Finally I reveal it, party people they can't wait until
Starts to boom out, so every rap consumer
Can bring that old schooler back just like alumni

I sting it, boo yah, to stop the half steppers
Tryin' to wing it through ya
Don't make me have to bring it to ya
Who gonna be the next clown to come step into my bounds
Right now get down for the crown
Mess around? Get pound to the ground by the sound

And let the more experienced entertain
Kane, meet the microphone, microphone, meet Kane
The legendaire, rap extraordinaire
Commutin' to your ear, yeah, looka here

We Entaprizin', got the hip hop heads realizin'
East Coast, West Coast organizin'
Steady risin', money sizin'
What we specialize in

I seen her in the subway, on my way to Brooklyn
Hello, good looking, is this seat tooken
On the A-train, picking at her brain
I couldn't get her number, I couldn't get her name
I said I still like your style of fashion
But I hate your hostile, 'itty attitude wit a passion
Is it because brothers like to hawk alot
Is it because your sign don't talk alot
She turned away, no play, I said ok
You don't really look good, I hope you have a bad day
Sat back, relaxed though the ride was tight
I was thinking of the rhymes I wrote last night
Next stop was mine, a familar scene
I was meeting my friend, killer Ben in Ft Green
Where the girls are real, they tell ya how they feel
If you're soft, you're soft, or if you're hard like steel
See i don't bend and I won't rust
And I don't break and I won't bust
Stomped up the street and did I hear a treat?
Hard high heels tappin' on the concrete
I took a peek, it was the girl from the train behind me
Did she live in the area, was she trying to find me?
Hm, I didn't wanna play myself out
I played it off, stopped and I bought a Guiness Stout
Now was she shy, she didn't walk by
She came in the store then she even said hi
Curiosity- at a high velocity
Maybe possibly she had the hots for me
i said if we're playing games then we're gonna play mine
I'm a lay the rules 'cause it ain't much time
If you hide your feelings, and they hard to find,
I wanna know what's on your mind

CHORUS

About a week went by and I called her, "Hello"
I said yo, can I speak to, um, she said no
Hey yo, I know I didn't call, I didn't wanna stress you
Go out my way to impress you, press to undress you
See I wanna get to know you so I can show you
What a strong relationship can grow to
But you gotta trust me and you're gonna love me
Squeeze the phone and hug me, use your mind to rub me
Now how does it feel when my mental, massage ya temple
Telephone's hot from the vibes that I sent you
Now tell me your inner thoughts and deepest emotions
Next you see ectacy's explosions
Now I'm coming to see you to spend some time
I'm a romantic warrior but is it a crime
And if you hide your feelings and they hard to find...

I wanna know what's on your mind
I wanna know what's on your mind

Now it's been months and it's smooth and lovely
I'm in your head so you'll be thinking of me
So we met in Queens and went to Valley Streams
And, uh, couldn't remember the movie we just seen
But it's Wednesday, take the train uptown
How do the 125th street sound

Amateur night, Showtime at the Apollo
Probably be watching Bill Cosby tomorrow
Then after that get into it, I mean intimate
Every word is an instrument
Making sounds and tones and songs and moans
My lips so close to your ear, it's like headphones
You smile, you said you never know what the day will bring
It's always a new song to sing
The next day I went back to the her rest
Knocked on the door, intentions: finesse
She let me in and had nothing but a neglige on
Smelling like Liz Claiborne
I sat down and got comfortable and watched the Huxtables
She sat next to me and said what's up wit you
I got the feeling for sexual healing
A mental healing ; how you feeling
She caught the effect and said she feel the same
Could you massage my intellect and stop the pain
Desire's yearning, the fire's burning
You hot 'cause it's alot you're learning
Now I'm ready to explore you inner world
It's take a long time cuz I'm just beginning, girl...
Take it easy, cut off the TV
Cut off the lights, use your mind to see me,
Use your physical form if I'm hard to find
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...
'Cause now I know what's on your mind...

Whoever underestimated, still waited
Pumping the radio, finally they played it
You wondered how come the album was late
I was giving you time to get the last one straight,
The show must go on, I got something to dance to
Slow it down and romance to and give me a chance to
Keep you in tune and up to par...
Then you're doing it with the R...
Doing it wit the R...

Something new and to keep you doing what'cha doing
This is for you and your crew and for who in
The vicinity, I don't need no identity
I see hands in the air that means many be
Cooperating, I can't stop relating
Hip-hop is making more sense when I'm stating
Paragraphs of potential to prevent you
From using my instrumental, keep in mind I meant to
Illustrate another iller break immediately
Hurry up and learn the words and repeat it wit me
Then soon you're in tune and up to par
And then you're doing it wit the R...
Keep doing it, you keep doing it wit the R...

In the Summertime, pockets bulging
Somethings's happening then I'm indulging
Music is mine, Gucci seats reclined,
Gold grill, a paint job will shine.
Pull up in the park and then pop the trunk
Turn up the bass and let the system thump
A block party starts to form, people start to swarm
Loud as a ghetto blaster, word is bond
Records remind you of a madness
The moment it's played, you get gladdest
The return of the brother, keeping you up to par
And you're doing it wit the R...

Shout outs...

Casualties of war

Casualties of war, as I approach the barricade
Where's the enemy? Who do I invade?
Bullets of teflon, bulletproof vest rip
Tear ya outta ya frame with a bag full of clips

'Cause I got a family that waits for my return
To get back home is my main concern
I'ma get back to New York in one piece
But I'm bent in the sand that is hot as the city streets

Sky lights up like fireworks blind me
Bullets, whistlin' over my head remind me
President Bush said attack
Flashback to 'Nam, I might not make it back

Missile hits the area, screams wake me up
From a war of dreams, heat up the M-16
Basic training, trained for torture
Take no prisoners and I just caught ya

Addicted to murder, send more body bags
They can't identify 'em, leave the name tags
I get a rush when I see blood
Dead bodies on the floor

Casualties of war
Casualties of war
Casualties of war
Casualties of war

Day divides the night and night divides the day
It's all hard work and no play
More than combat, it's far beyond that
'Cause I got a kill or be killed kind of attack

Area's mapped out, there'll be no Stratego
Me and my platoon make a boom wherever we go
But what are we here for? Who's on the other side of the wall?
Somebody give the President a call

But I hear warfare scream through the air
Back to the battlegrounds, it's war they declare
A Desert Storm, let's see who reigns supreme
Something like Monopoly, a government scheme

Go to the Army, be all you can be
Another dead soldier? Hell no, not me
So I start letting off ammunition in every direction
Allah is my only protection

But wait a minute, Saddam Hussein prays the same
And this is Asia, from where I came
I'm on the wrong side, so change the target
Shooting at the general, and where's the sergeant?

Blame it on John Hardy Hawkins for bringing me to America
Now it's mass hysteria
I get a rush when I see blood
Dead bodies on the floor

Casualties of war
Casualties of war
Casualties of war
Casualties of war

The war is over, for now at least
Just because they lost it don't mean it's peace
It's a long way home, it's a lot to think about
Whole generation, left in doubt

Innocent families killed in the midst
It'll be more dead people after this
So I'm glad to be alive and walkin'
Half of my platoon came home in coffins

Except the general, buried in the Storm
In bits and pieces no need to look for 'em
I played it slick and got away with it
Rigged it up so they would think they did it

Now I'm home on reserves and you can bet
When they call, I'm going AWOL
'Cause it ain't no way I'm going back to war
When I don't know who or what I'm fighting for

So I wait for terrorists to attack
Every time a truck backfires I fire back
I look for shelter when a plane is over me
Remember Pearl Harbor? New York could be over, G

Kamikaze, strapped with bombs
No peace in the East, they want revenge for Saddam
Did I hear gunshots or thunder?
No time to wonder, somebody's going under

Put on my fatigues and my camouflage
Take control, 'cause I'm in charge
When I snapped out of it, it was blood and
Dead bodies on the floor

Casualties of war
Casualties of war
Casualties of war
Casualties of war

Ayo
I'm like Malcolm out the window with the joint
Hoodied up blood in my eye, a lead to fly
Like fuck it , look how these niggas duck shit
One kid hollerin what lookin up, he the big wig
Fake ass cat, low life, sodomize mind
Beatin niggas, big bricks of bread sellin mad dimes
His feet hurt, networkin he get no work
Yo smack him where his hand hurt, fuck what he worth
Yo he sucked his thumb smooth for the kid laced with the big guns
Stain to my Baltimore niggas that he on the run
Plus he ill in the drums, heartburn for life, calcium man
Watch him grab the Tums, he's a front
Pigeon totalist sister with the fat ass
Show hash behind up the block plus he smashed her
Big Bub did him somethin deadly, act premedidtated
Buck 60 strike was the medley
Nice like Van Halen, seen him at the tunnel with his skin peelin
Did two days thought he was jailin
You get close, look at his hands
That's the same kid that cut his wrists, talkin bout the cuffs did it
He ran away, frontin majorly, eyes like Sammy Davis jr.
Rounded off with a fade g, he sport the Bob Hope classics
Ran down Asics, Kmart, the short sleeve shit be the basics
He eat hams shitted on himself twice, big hatted Jews
Rushed the nigga out in Crown Heights

CHORUS:
Yo let me tell you how the game go
We gettin rid of all the prostitutes
Tony wants the streets back fo sho
Too many hustlers, too many thieves
We're fuckin up who's willin to fight and teach the c's
Too much TV, guns and robberies
Lust and greed and hate the 4 devils jealousy


Yo I champunch Mase in his face over some bullshit
The other night they kidnapped his brother pokin it with knives
It's rainin, 85 degrees kinda muggy
One of the nights they thrown in his face it's real ugly
Yo we up in Jonesy's posin, all these niggas know me
>From fuckin wit, under theses niggas heavy parolees
Yo we played the speaker
And from a distance we could see these chains
The P slayed, flat on his chest, was two plains
Ashy hands yo, no need for rings at all
He just cracked the V8 backed up, leaned against the wall
Lookin flower, he just came home, he on like a fuck
Did a dime for holdin up the gods up in the armored truck
Ten years later son 280 on the weight tip
He throwin up six plates plus he studied Matrix
He's a wally horse shout it out sweatin through his valor
Cock-eyed nigga back up his neck he had shores
Sammy eagerly rode up on him, taxi off the turkey with the joint
On him
Flower look his man stood up before him
The bitches hit the table, Jah king stripped off his cables
Shots went off, Sam'll get a chance to make his debut
Flower grabbed Tiff his man with the sideburns, hat fell off
We nerd his wigworms, he hid behind Rich
See Allah hit the light switch, young girls were trampled
In the measured pool, pistol with Mase, and broke the handle
Desperate crawlin to the door on all fours
Shim kicked the jukebox the theme song rode in was "It's Yours"
Oh my goodness, Ba grabbed the Mo bottle thrashin
He layin like a gay models shoutin out Sebastian
He smiled with his teeth missin begging for mercy
No more god, the 68 thousand down a pair of three
Out came the cannon, whistled out zaggin
Cham snatched his flag four big rocks enter the dragon
It's over, another story told
Lyin with the snakes, tongue kissin cobras

CHORUS

Uh, never good enough
Baby nothin's ever good enough
Uh, it's what? Uh


Nothin's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
 So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear
Cause why?  Nothin's ever good enough
I'm just lookin for somethin, good enough


Wonder where his mind is
If everyone's impression is wrong then maybe mine is
Jury's out, but the verdict's in
Case ain't been heard, so how they murderin him?
I appear to be arrogant, that's what they instilled in me
Took it as a weakness when I showed 'em humility
Insensitive, don't waste time tryin to tell me
what emotions is - I'm emotionless
I can't explain it, it comes from home
Make me uncomfortable and you gon' put me in a comfort zone
Double is me, feel what I feel and know he's strugglin
Be tryin to get depression and sufferin from ME
When your head's cluttered with noise you get lost
Am I isolated by choice or by force?
Listen, the FUCK y'all expect from me?
Already given y'all the best of me
But it seem like!


Nothin's ever good enough
Hollywood, think he too good for us
Nigga's emo, he ain't in the hood enough
How 'bout he's just misunderstood to us
Vision is fine, I can still hear
 So I pop one more 'til everything is unclear
Cause, just one wasn't good enough
Crushin it in rum wasn't good enough
The baddest girl wouldn't be good enough
All the cash in the world ain't good enough
 Cause you can go your hardest for your fans
But like you they only human so they may not understand that
I used to always try to be good enough
And couldn't figure out why I wasn't good enough
So instead of bein good enough
I just wan' be better, than good enough


The FRUCK's goin on around here?
Contrivin and conformin is the norm around here
It's tension, speak up and violence gets mentioned
In the world where everybody gets by off silenced opinions
And so I cut the red tape and the politics
Know it's there, I'm just the only nigga to acknowledge it
Learn from the acts that came before ya and retain the lawyer
They told me, "Once you get the fame you get the paranoia"
They say that he a has-been, irrelevant
But e'ry word I say niggaz get hella bent
Tell you why I'm off of the charts, or on the bottom of your bracket
I rap through the heart and some niggaz lack it
So I get why I'm greeted with spite
Got nerve bein the truth, life's fine with them believin a lie!
Even I no longer know what to expect from me
But y'all have yet to see the best in me
Still it seem like!




Check it; I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me and you normally hear a reply for it
But I'm startin my maturation
and ignore 'em, let 'em continue they masturbation
Say my actions don't match what I'm spittin
So I tell 'em mind they business and let me stray
They say that you becomin a walkin contradiction
I tell 'em people change every day
I tell 'em I've been makin my own decisions since a teen
Tell me who the fuck is y'all to intervene - here's a lesson
I'm good enough for me, a nigga seem to be perfection
Fifty grand, V.I.P., queens, imperfections
Far from a beginner, nigga ain't a white belt
Cry me a river, and I'll turn into Mike Phelps
I'm just givin y'all the best of me
And y'all just turn that into stress for me
And so it seem like!

Uh-ohhhh, uh-oh
Uh-ohhhhhh! That on top, ohh!
Ta-ha, Joey 
No comment, no comment
Ta-ha, whole bunch of yappin
Jersey! That M.J. bullshit
Let me talk to 'em, l-look look look


Since the world don't revolve around me
 Hoodie on, revolver on me
I'm the wrong one you wanna amp 
Cause niggaz could get missin
like you straight out of LeBron's summer camp 
Anytime the fed's see me
I tell 'em that the only thing FUCKERY here gets you an STD
My life, should be sold as a movie
From the  tryin to be a , no groupies
When did the civilians decide to be a thug?
Motivated by the hate  inspired by the love
Rappers sayin my name like it's a bright tactic
Jackson 5, put your  in a casket
Let the fans gas you and tell you you're nice
Be a legend in RAP, but a failure in life
For real, I don't think these dudes is spectacular
Pretty Ricky thugs who move like spectacular, nigga!


What up with you and so-and-so? Heard you got a diss
Don't know about THAT, but I know about this nigga
No comment  no comment 
No comment, I ain't got a comment
Bloggers, Twitter, Budden TV
No comment, y'all ain't gettin nothin from me
I said, no comment  no comment
No comment, I ain't got a comment


So I been called a snitch 
But I been called worse by better so let's skip over the lecture
That's a common lie 
Cause if I ever call the cops it's only gon' be to report a homicide
How am I in beef? I walk about free
They only talk about YOU, when you talk about ME
So go ahead and act hard
And somebody gon' grab chalk  and turn the streets into a blackboard
So I'm supposed to put niggaz on a pedestal
for rappin 'bout a bunch of bullshit that they don't ever do
You look stupid when you go there
Say I'm only hot online you ain't heatin up nowhere
SHOT-gun in SHOT-gun, ride right past ya
Windows down, got every right to blast ya
No wonder he thinkin he'll provide a disaster
Cause bitches keep tellin him that size don't matter 



Things niggaz say I don't mind it
Say they lost respect for me, who the FRUCK is askin you to find it?
This is me practicin censorship
Since the new definition of real nigga is sensitive
In his interview, say I'm askin for a hearse
But couple months BACK he was askin for a verse
Only hurts is the team used to bump you
Now he look like a fiend, I should slump you

Anybody who listens to Joe Budden
I never got off on it, actually my image is not giving a fuck about image
My image is a regular, real live man who will always give it to you just the way it is
I'm never gonna fabricate, I'm never gonna lie
and I'm never going to? cuz the industry made me do something
Some of you gotta take a step back, and really just look at the situation, and analyze
To really think about it. And you gotta say "is the risk... worth the reward?"
Let's go


Yo I'm only human, ain't to be worshipped 
I'm only human, I ain't perfect 
I might say some things and reword it
You could blame it on my roots, deep Jerz shit
Bet some things were never instilled
I might make threats I will never fulfill 
Hoping you're smart enough to use some will
And do as I say out of fear that I will
Say time will reveal, but I'm jammed up
But I'm standin at the clock and the hands stuck
Ever so tender, seems the things ya'll never forget
I'll never remember
Listen, it's your fault you assumed I grew
But if I'm all about me, then wheres there room for you?
Rather not rewind but fast forward
"Forgiveness", all I can do is ask for it
Forgive me


I'm only human like ya'll and shit
I ain't a robot, I ain't a superhero
I'm entitled to shit like ya'll niggas
Here we go, check me out


Might say some things thats outlandish
But when I do, I'm thinking without standage
I apologize, take it as a letter
In spite of my actions just know I was raised better 
I'm aware that my opinions hated
So why the fuck am I so opinionated?
My bad Method Man, out of respect
I'ma scrap them 5 pages I wrote towards  Deck
cuz that aint have anything to do with you
So I made it have everything to do with you
Shuttin' up is unusual
So I'm back to lettin my pen state what I do to dudes 
Outside of music, outside of rappin
Cuz none of that shit interfere with life happenin
And you can look me dead in the eyes
If you dont know shit then just know I took your advice
Holla at me


At least I listen though
I'm open minded enough to
A nigga tell me something I'ma take heed to it
Only if its good shit though
I be my own filter
It's that on top music
Think more niggas should be like that
Follow my lead
I left a trail for niggas
Follow it


Yo, yo I ain't lookin at the man that you would see
Ain't looking at the man that you should see
Ain't looking at the man that I could be
Treat me like I'm new to the game, still a rookie
Like a newborn straight out the pussy
Or is everybody straight out and just pussy 
In a state of confusion, what I intended is never the conclusion 
I'm losin, normally the one they accusin
Maybe that explain my seclusion
But when you grown to see that the stakes high
You at least know to never make the same mistake twice 
They say the real is gone
I represent this shit
What you see is what you get
No representative
From now on gator redefine me
If ya see another mishap dont mind me
Forgive me


Ya know I heard a lot of niggas
Words are piercing
Sometimes they just hurt like bullets
I wanna make amends
Nnot to everybody though
Some of yall niggas I mean to offend

<|endoftext|>

Author: Joe Budden


Chea... Escape Route... its, its that on top music
Chea, talk to em, the top
Ohhh!? on the track
JOEY
It's ya man, holla at him


Now look, look, look, look
They say once you get to a certain age
At a certain point you hit a certain phase
Become hard to break out of certain ways
No matter how bad you tryin' to impersonate
So I promised, I swore
I start doin things that I aint never done before
Going against my core, I was sure my new chore
Would be to go and see some shit that I never saw
I.E, I swore that when I left man
I'd never say another word about a Def Jam
When you look at the big picture gotta figure that
No matter right or wrong they interpret the shit as bitter
Niggggas, they don't care its what they ask me
They don't care that I just answered this shit last week
And lastly, not a thing will slip past me
And most of these gangstas is bitches, ask apache
Nigggga


Uh uh uh, never
Uh, uh, never
Uh, talk to..., never
Nuh, uh, you already know
Never again
One quarter of the Slaughter


Yo yo yo
Modern day Hercules on the track
Even if it brings me to my knees
I still put Jersey on my back
I swore id never cheat cuz as hard as it made my girl cry 
Man that day I felt my world die 
Insensitive, so if you see me going through emotion
Most the time I'm going through the motions
I swore id never played or could but the CL so good
If I change my mind I'm going through it ghostin
Forgive me father, I swore I'd never lie again
But couldnt fight temptation, I had to try again
Swore I was done with vicodin 'til I changed my mind's mind
And convinced him it was harmless, just vitamins
I swore id never make another song
Contrived to conform to some shit that didnt belong
Orrrr, how about I never say never
If I start today, cant expect me to see something that far away


Nahimean? it aint tunnel vision or nothing like that
How the fluck...
Uhhhhh, uhhh
One more 'gain
How you sposed to see nothin?
You cant!
Its, its, its that amalgam music


Yo swore I'd never respond to haters
Honestly its draining
But on the other side its entertaining
Built a shield that would never let the pain in
Armed with an alarm to notify me if it came in
And some niggas say I'm changing
So I swore to never be with them even though I agree with em
For better or for worse like a wedding
You chillin with a chameleon, I just adapt to my settings
Take a momento, and see a man without a memory
I don't remember me, mentally in fact similarly
It's just me and my alter ego
Pardon us, swore to never dumb it down but fans wont smarten up
I swore it never be another Mood Muzik
Or it'd be a while, I ain't in the mood to do it
I helped the game do away with all the trash
Never live in the past, treat everyday like its my last motherfucker


Treat everyday like its ya last one
Tomorrow's not a promise!
Haha
Words of advice, words of wisdom
Its, its, its, that Amalgam music
Testing, haha
Just testing

Planet Earth was my place of birth
Born to be the SOLE controller of the universe
Besides the part of the map I hit first
Any a rhyme that I can adapt when it gets worst
The rough gets going, the going gets rough
When I start flowing, the mic might bust
The next state, I shake from the power I generate
People in Cali used to think it was earthquakes
'Cause times was hard on the Boulevard
So I vote God and never get scarred and gauled
But it seems like I'm locked in hell
Looking over the edge but the R never fell
A trip to slip 'cause my Nikes got grip
Stand on my own two feet and come equip
Any stage I'm seen on, I'M LIKE A PHENOM
I stand alone and need nothing to lean on
Going for self wit a long way to go
So much to say but I still flow slow
I come correct and I won't look back
'Cause it ain't where you're from, it's where
you're at
Even the 

I learn to relax in my room and escape from New York
And return through the womb of the world as a
thought
Thinking how hard it was to be born
BEING EQUIPPED wit no physical form
Millions OF CELLS wit one destination
To reach the best part, it's life creation
9 months later, a job well done
Make way, 'cause here I come
Since I made it this far, I can't stop now
There's a will and a way and I got THE know-how
To be all I can be and more
And see all there is to see before
I'M Called and go back to the essence
It's alot to learn so I study my lessons
I thought the ghetto was the worst that could
happen to me
I'm glad I listen when my father was rapping to me
'Cause back in the days, they lived in caves
ExileD from the original man, a straight way
Now that's what I call hard times
I rather be here to exercise the mind
Then I take a thought around the world twice
From knowledge NEWBORN back to knowledge precise
Across the desert, that's HOT AS THE ARABIAN
But they couldn't cave me in 'cause I'm the Asian
REaching for the city OF Mecca, visit Medina
Visions of Neffertiti then I seen a
Mind keeps traveling, I'll be back after I
Stop and think about the brothers and sisters in
Africa
Return the thought through the eye of a needle
For miles I thought and I just fought the people
Under the dark skies on a dark side
Not only there but right here's an apartheid
So now is the time for us to react
Take a trip through the mind and when you get back
Understand you're third eye seen all of that
It ain't where you're from, it's where you're at
Even the 
Even the 

No more props, I want property
In every borough, nobody's stopping me
Because I'm thorough, rhymes are making real estate
for me to own
Wherever I bless a microphone
007 is back and relaxing
On POINT N' reactin' and ready for action
I'm so low key that you might not see me
Incognito and taking it easy
Quiet, it's kept on a hush hush
In front of a crowd, I get loud, there's a bumrush
Be calm, keep a low pro, and play the background
HOPIN' the wack rapper'LL put the mic back down
So rip it, break it in half, go head and slam it
'Cause when it's time to build, I'm a mechanic
I'm bonding and mending, attaching and blending
So many solos, there is no ending
People in my neighborhood, they know I'm good
From London to Hollywood, wherever I stood
Footprints remain on stage ever since
As I walk the street, I leave fossils and dents
When I had sex, I left my name on necks
My trademark was left throughout the projects
I used to get rich when I played celo
When I rolled 4, 5, 6, they go we know
So I collect my cash then slide
I got my back, my gun's on my side
It shouldn't have to be like that
I guess it ain't where you're from, it's where
you're at
Even the 
I'm from the 
Word up, peace

Good Evening

Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to welcome everybody
Please take your seats
Please be seated
We have a great show lined up for everybody tonight
Special guest in the house tonight
Joe Budden, J.Garden
Let's... GO


A wise man said we all wear a mask
At times keepin it on is too much of a task
Your face on the net, and your life's on blast
It might slip off, you gotta give me a pass
Sometimes I feel like a mannequin
But how they dress me don't make me the man I am
Not a rose dont hamper him
They just lookin' at the clothes on a mannequin


Look, look, look
I want the best cars and the best flow
I want the best broads thats how that go
I mean I want to be a star and collect dough
But even if I had it all it'd be just for show
I want the diamonds to make my neck glow 
Lust for the next hoe a love will never let go 
I want to run along from my shortcomings 
But I smoke so my breath gonna be short running 
I want to be in control, hands on
If I'm the pilot then we will never land wrong 
But I want to have faith, staying strong
Take the first step when I ain't got a leg to stand on
I got a lot to give but I want more
With numb thoughts, positive but i'm unsure
On the misplace, getaway and its disarray
And yall don't know the man just what he put on display 




I'm too annoyed to cope, tryna make a livin
Given I dont think that being a dope boy is dope
Out of every story, only 2 end in glory
Who am I to think I'm different than every hustler before me?
If I took my anger, became a gangbanger
I would aim to aim my anger at every stranger
Shawty wanna leave, honestly I can't blame her
Say the ones you love the most are always in the most danger
I talk a little slower so you have to hear
Dead man walkin, no tatted tears
Or realest to ever do it, cavalier
Hundred thousand dollar car, with rabbit ears
I don't welcome change even if it help 'em gain
Fuck a handout, I'd rather be self contained
L.V everything, lookin' well arranged
Y'all would never know that I'm practicing self restrain




I been different, never mind I'm just indifferent
Ain't an old timer that would blame it on a skin pigment
Is it my imagination or a slim figment?
Or is gent ignant, probably why im indignant
Look at haters like 'why is it an issue?'
Is it because I'm sober but I'm on a high they can't get to?
God? fightin with his pride and his pitbull
God I was lied as it get to
Cursin' God out "why he decide to pick dude?"
I big bulls but when I try its abyssmal
Die and keepin everythin inside me a riddle
But they blinded by the condo size and it's sick view
Whys, try and answer the whys
What good is havin eyes when everything you look at you despise? 
Or do you need ears when you dont believe anything you hear?
Maybe it's just something in the air

If you think that it's so damn easy
Then what do you need me for?
Just look at the state of you
Babe, snap out of it
You're not listening to this


Yeah... talk to 'em! Ohh
HUH? Joey!
It's, it's, that on top

Must be I'm just avoidin the inevitable, dodgin my fate
So many things a nigga gotta escape
Autobiographical, I need my life to maybe hop on a page
that'll end with a sigh, goodbye, with my mouth open cockin a gauge
How you the greatest at your job, but they dockin your pay?
Guess when God's holdin a bar they start mockin your ways
Murder my fans while I'm rockin on stage
Naw let me chill, I ain't thinkin at a logical state
I catch 'em while they noddin they head, sayin the words
And start a blood bath, right as they repeatin the verse
at the show let 'em know that they help lead to me bein disturbed
I'm thinkin {"You're not making any sense"} ha ha, listen 
How much longer you expect me to be degraded
by niggaz who can't appreciate bein appreciated?
Y'all made this beef related
One less person to judge, just one more problem alleviated 




Ya mean, uh, fruck's goin on?
Yeah! Listen

I'll stand before your honor, without a alibi, lost kinda
Just a product of a lost genre
Cuffed like I'ma cause drama, headline un-remorsed trauma
Sweat drippin from my head like I performed a concert
No alibi for my unlawful conduct
I need a pardon from the president, call Obama
And tell him I was goin all out
I was doin God's work, I thought the nigga called out

{"Snap out of it, you're not making any sense"}
They don't hear me, check it!

You lookin at a more honest improve in me
All of the comments and scutiny, drive him to lunacy
Committin hate crimes as if I got immunity
A opportune time to have opportunity
Not, but when he don't stop by it just ruins me
Pride is persuin me, why's it rebukin me?
I got demons by my door, staked out
I'm inside goin over my escape route




Now I've had it up to here
Don't ever try that again
Why are you so quiet so suddenly?
Go on, have it
You're just dying to tryyyyy me!


Yeah, uh-huh-uh, uhh
Muh'frucker, uh, uh
Let me tell you

Yo, see I'm in search of privacy
On e'ry social network, but don't wan' network with society
That's, probably why my net worth ain't so high to me
These Percosets work, now they FUCKIN with my sobriety
I'm chasin a hit - all in Heath Ledge
 overdose, I ain't chasin the SHIT!
I got a audience, they just got me hatin this shit
Or is it how I view life, and how vacant it is
Watch me and see a horrible movie, bad reviews
Scattered views with a cold heart, wrong attitude
I ain't got a thing in common with these rapper dudes
Nigga! {"You're not making any sense"}
Okay, aside from some drawn-out thoughts, mags and tools
I don't think they know what it FEEL like to be battered, bruised
And still they can't see me with the ink
So try fuckin the world ain't as easy as you think, nigga!




Oh, Joey! Ta-ha
Fruck's goin on?
You need me for?
Fuck them all niggaz, geah
The fruck's goin on?
Nigga! Ta-ha, yeah
It's, it's...
Warn yourself

I'm the arsenal
I got artillery, lyrics of ammo
Rounds of rhythm, then I'm 'a give 'em a piano
Bring a bullet-proof vest, nothin' to ricochet
Ready? Aim at the brain, now what the trigger say
Tempos triflin', felt like a rifle
Massage 'n' melodies, might go right through simultaneously like an Uzi
Nothin' can bruise me
Lyrics let up when lady say don't lose me
So re-load quickly, and you better hit me while I'm lettin' this fifi get wit me
You steppin' with .007, better make it snappy
No time to do your hair baby, brothers are bustin' at me
Beats and bullets pass me, none on target
They want the R hit, but watch the god get
Quicker, the tongue is the trigger
Cause I'm real fast
Let off some rhythm at 'em, let 'em feel the blast
Penetrate at a crazy rate, This ain't no .38
Hit 'em at point blank range and watch 'em radiate
Runnin' out of ammunition, I'm done wit' em
You ask me how I did 'em
I let the rhythm hit 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, let it hit 'em
Let the rhythm hit 'em, know what i mean?

South suicide queens... all niggaz
Gather up all your arms
And get ready for this new world order
Shit is about to change muther fucker

I'm america's nightmare
Young black and just dont give a fuck
I just want to get high and live it up
So fuck in '95
And why you tryin to slave us
With minimum wages
Slammin my niggas up in cages
Changing their behaivors

And spittin razors thats outraegeous

Smoking moaches is hopeless
We want lazy sofas and sculptures
Lady chauffers who fuck us
Full house and royal flushes
Roll with the rush
Its the official nas
Got bitches with pistols and cash
We living in the last

My theory is "fuck it"
Sexy niggas get obducted
My corrupted
Is conducted
Through ghettos
Sippin amaretto
Hand on the metal
Foot on the pedal

Never settle
We wear carolina herrera
Dirty donna karan sweaters
Wrap over leathers and seudes
Gold plated guns and grenades
To blow up
I got news from the informers

I'm trapped in corners
Bustin shots at time-warner

Hey yo
My man big todd
He know how to get by
He high

Threw a jinx
Then be fixed to be fly
Submit crossing up
And downtown action
And when he sticky keeper grip and move with traction
Keep mad alibies

A plan to stay wise and wide eyed
Living in the state of south side
Crooked jakes

And fakes snake
Niggas all out for papes
Oh who wanna over take and leave you with drapes
The white sheet covers
This heat smuthers the street
Eat brothers
Ten shots rang
You got banged
We all ready for these wars

We all want more
These the last days get yours

32 shots and certed the glocks
You heard it for blocks
The murdering guys
Convertible drops
Living life on the edge of dangerous
Where you living
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it
Cause it be off the Crooks crash
Cheeba spots
And selling rocks
The cops around the clock
Is hot
Living life on the edge of dangerous
Where you living
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it

Thinking about taking my own life
I might as well
'cept they might not sell weed in hell
And thats where i'm going
Cause the devil's inside of me
They make me rob from my own nationality
Its kind of ignorant
But yo i gotta pay the rent
So yeah, i'll stick a nigga most definite
Cause its generate
If i get caught i'm innocent
Cause i dont leave no sticky finga prints
For the cops
They only good if they dead
All that badge and that gun shit be going to they head
To make bread i gotta steal for sport
So i stole the show and sell some pennies for my thoughts
And if this fucking rap shit dont pay
I'ma start selling drugs around my way
Killin my own people in the usg
Shit they gonna get it from somebody
I'd rather it be me
Besides... you cant tax dirty money
And you cant trust nobody 
No one 
I'm the scorpion
And i'll probably bite the bullet
Cause i live by the gun

We came to hear these 25 to life niggas who just came out
And pull flame out
Take aim
Blow your brains out
Its life on the edge of dangerous
Where you living
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it
In south suicide queens where niggaz act up
Nigga back up
Official nas-throw your fucking gats up
Its life on the edge of dangerous
Where you living
Never giving a shit
Cause we living in it
We never giving a shit
Cause we living in it
Official nas mother fuckers dont give a shit
Word up

Yo I formed a crew, niggas straight tell me I'm slippin'
I'm the boss of this fam, I need to watch my position
Bitches are sneaky, triflin', and not to be trusted
A weak link in the team, in the chain of combustion
Don't trust her, love is for suckas
Too many enemies is out there son, tryin' to bring the ruckus
Keep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade
Keep doin' what we doin', gettin' money and gettin' paid

Enemies all around me
One mistake and they'll down me
They just wanna rain on my parade
I said the enemies all around you
One mistake and they'll down you
They just wanna rain on your parade

It's mind-boggling the heart wants it, the mind rejects it
Fuck the past, let's put the present in perspective
That's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me
Stand butt-naked in the storm, sippin' the frosty
Force me to choose, I'mma follow my heart
She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart
No more Delucas, straight Killa Bee on the swarm
And when it's time to get big, she put her game face on

WOODROW: Hey, Brother Stark!
Brother Stark: Tony Starks, Ghostface’s alter ego
GHOSTFACE: What up, ‘Dro?
WOODROW: A-yo, what up, my motherfuckin’ nigga?
GHOSTFACE: Ha, my nigga, what’s that, it’s my mother—ahhhhhhhhhh…
...
GHOSTFACE: What up, kid?
WOODROW: A-yo, man, why y’all niggas playing me? ‘Cause Woodrow ain’t never hurt no-motherfuckin-body…
GHOSTFACE:  Ahhh, stop fakin’…
WOODROW: Get these big niggas off me, man…
GHOSTFACE: Ah, ‘Dro, you wild, ‘Dro. What up, G?
WOODROW: A-yo, let me get two. Let me get two
Woodrow is asking for two rocks of crack, and handing over nine dollars. He’s one dollar short 
GHOSTFACE:  C’mon, ‘Dro. You know I can’t fuck with you like that, ‘Dro, y’know dunn?
WOODROW: I’m saying, man, I know y’all motherfuckers say cash rules everything around you, but crack rules everything around me, motherfucker!
GHOSTFACE: Stop that, ‘Dro! Damn!
WOODROW: Know what I’m sayin’? Now, like I said, I got nine dollars for yo’ ass, know what I’m sayin’… you know, I come through—
GHOSTFACE: ‘Dro ‘Dro ‘Dro, you got the most G in the world, ‘Dro, slow down, pard… Slow down. C’mon… C’mon, Dro-Dro!
WOODROW: I’m sayin’! It ain’t no motherfuckin’ game, nigga, I come through with the TV’s… I come through with the VC—
GHOSTFACE: Christmas tomorrow, man! Christmas tomorrow!
WOODROW: And I’m gonna come through for y’all motherfuckers all over here! Stapleton, y’all niggas know how I do! And I’m from uptown, I don’t even motherfuckin’ supposed to be around here, but I come around here, and I spread my motherfuckin’ love. Now I’m saying, give me two cracks, let me go on the roof, take my two—
GHOSTFACE: Alright yo. Damn, man… C’mon, but you know… you’re like fam, god…
WOODROW:—and get on my shit!
GHOSTFACE: Alright, duke, C’mon ‘Dro, you like fam, man, I love you, man. I love you, man… C’mon ‘Dro!
GHOSTFACE: God… damn, ‘Dro! 
WOODROW: Come on, man, Come on! Brother Stark!
GHOSTFACE:  Damn
WOODROW: Look, see I always gotta go through this shit, man… y’all niggas are supposed to be Big Willies, you actin’ a little silly, motherfucker!
GHOSTFACE: That ain’t got nothin’…that ain’t even got nothin’ to do with it, ‘Dro, c’mon, ‘Dro

GHOSTFACE: Nah, those are—Those are my niggas, right there! Overseein’—
WOODROW:  You think I don’t carry a motherfuckin’ pistol, nigga?
BODYGUARD: Ease up, ease up
WOODROW: ‘Cause I’m a crackhead?
Now things get really serious. Woodrow has pulled out a pistol in front of two large and presumably armed bodyguards. He could easily get murdered for that. Ghost is clearly worried, not as much for his own life as for Woodrow’s
GHOSTFACE: Yo ‘Dro, stop that, man. Stop that, man. See now, c’mon, baby…
WOODROW: Nigga, I got a motherfuckin’ nickel plated .380, I go down to my old lady house, man, I tell her, “Suzie, throw it out the window! Suzie!”
GHOSTFACE:  Ay-yo, you wild
WOODROW: Don’t play with me, mother— “Sue!”
GHOSTFACE: You wild, ‘Dro. Stop it, braw…
WOODROW: Back the fuck up, motherfuckers!
GHOSTFACE: Nah it’s all… it’s all good. This is my, this is my nigga right here, this is ‘Dro
WOODROW: Now… Brother Stark. All I want is two, man. That’s all I want
GHOSTFACE: Listen, man. I can’t even do it like that… I can’t even do it, no, on the real, ‘Dro, I’m tight, God. I can’t do it like that. You know… c’mon, man. You like fam, God
WOODROW: Look, see I’m gonna have to go see the motherfuckin’ Rastas, then! I see I’m gonna have to go see the motherfuckin’ Rastas! They let a motherfucker get it for seven!
GHOSTFACE: Son, they just. You wonder why… you wonder why them niggas keep lookin’ at yo’ ass, huh? Fuck with them niggas like that!
WOODROW:  Fuck them, fuck you, and fuck this motherfuckin’ crack house! I’m out, motherfuckers! Fuck y’all motherfuckers!
GHOSTFACE: Yo ‘Dro, don’t disrespect my gate… don’t disrespect it. Don’t disrespect my gate like that
WOODROW: I don’t give a f—y’all won’t let me get two for nine dollars. One motherfuckin’ dollar?
GHOSTFACE: A yo ‘Dro… get the fuck out the house. Get the fuck out the gate, man. I’m about to knock you the fuck out
WOODROW:  Always want a motherfucker… get off me!

That's what i'm after tell me what i'm after
 




Once again it's the real ill microphone enhancer
Smoking mc's till i'm down from blunt enter
The mase is in my hand but i'm not afraid to shoot ya
Nobody can see me high in da future
So you know that no one can ever hurt me
Because i'm ill

Like herpies
And I really don't give a damn who you are
Mr.Funky man all hail i'm da funkular
Now in 1985 when the funk started to rock
Tryin to do the human beatbox like

All up in da place you can spit in yo face
Then when da beatbox start play
That's when I started rocking mic's
Make you wack mc's wanna fight
Because they alwayas try to battle Just to see who is da best
To see who is da best
So you know I have to roll on the quest
For what i'm after




Hip hop and props that's what what i'm after

Stacks of those plaq's that's what were after




If it's hip hop that makes yo knees knock
Turn us up box
I know you peep da sound it's the lords on the block
It's da list now this is how I live now
Making people get down to my funky sound
Ever since I heard the sound I wanted to be down
Here's my demo tape wont you please pass it down
So I can get paid and have thing's like I said
A car, a yacht, a house with a maid
But wow! slow down the party ain't that easy
Oh my god I think I let that video dicive me
No matter as long as the rhymes are the phatter
I bet yo billboard has me top of da ladder
Publishing like loving, I learded that from my cousin
Write you on tour you'll see thousands like the dozens
And after all dat if yo games phat
All I want to see is da golden platnium plaq







Now it's 1995
And I finally got my foot in da door
Got props I want more
Cause i'm definitly not where I used to be
But i'm no where near where I wanna be
I wanna be able to go out and buy a golf range
And still walk away with change
Until then there's no time to be wasting
So I gotta keep on chasing



Well! what i'm after that's simple
Come on and peep the mental
This ghetto born kid blowin up on instrumentals
What's the matter oh I know you can't peep my pattern
My style is desined to shed light like a lantern
Click click click now the light's directly on yo ear
If you peep da sound then run go tell a peer
What happined did you get locked by my rappin
You had to cause gold and the plat is what i'm after

Yeah, Soloman marked for life, a million to life
Thug for life, forever eyein' the kid
'89 stick-up kid, King of New York
Regulation party, daddy hard body
Rowdy Brighton God-body

Smooth like a leather bop, '83 hip-hop
Top of the world, get it rizzight big to your wizzife
Murder cats for the right prizzice
Four-hundred and fifty-six on the dizzice

This is real lizzife, ain't nothin' sweet God
Sit down and think it through God, God
'Cuz comin' all outta ya face'll get ya clap, God
You are now listening to the sounds of Supreme Clientele

Step in to the party, it's me
God Almighty, Ghost still holdin' that shotty
Dustin Alize', three-quarter Timbs, Terry-cloth robes
Crisp hundreds in the envelope, duke it on the globe

Thank God for my Wallabee shoes, they done saved me
Up three-nothin' and Salt Lake City
Burgundy minks, whips with sinks in 'em
Brocolli blown, illa disease breath, elephant skin

Meet the black Boy George, dusted on my honeymoon
Bitch like my wife, she popped my Ghostface balloon
Bitches think that I'm Dominican, slap-hash Indian
Milk on my mustache, drop to my chiny-chin
Dive into dangerous parts, buildin' with thirsty mammals
White man scream, "Swim Starks sharks"

Smack the girl, bailbonds man stripped of eighteen bronz man
Tall like Carl Malone "Mailman", framed on Larry Johnson
Tony Montana blow, creamy white Havana Joe's
Old Suzanna hoe, pussy sweet, banana flow
David Banner, gamma ray shots, beast will marinate
Bones splitted fatal Wu swords, sour amputate

Duck Savanna wait, we splashed the glass, ice rocks
Our cash high right stock, our logo's on your rice box
Plus your dice box, on the side upon your white socks
Bobby got the mic cocked, buck, buck, nice shot

See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable
Here comes Dark Gable raps remarkable
Mic ripper, cash flipper, Cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere that's French for ass whipper
Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was Rosa Parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from Mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a SAT
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the Kane story

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky

Fuck the
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't Erykah Badu
Black Caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on Priest Pai Mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment
The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how Jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the Kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for Fed Ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
I touch em what em do you know the style ain't nothing new

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live


A good game it lets the plot thicken,
but the thing that just ain't clickin'
Is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a Datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the Messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' em black
Closest thing to me would be; nothin' in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than Lauryn Hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin' through them like a finish line

Pretty little Sally sat up by the tree trunk
White miniskirt with a Betty Boom bum
She had a ass like Deborah Cox, face like Lauryn
Waist like a Coke bottles scoring
Pretty young thing loved the swings
And times she got my ding-a-ling hard
When she said push hard, she kept Vaseline
Open as she swung back, couldn't help her dress blue back

Now I'm held accountable right for my actions
Right before the Wallabee Champ was rockin' wallows
Drawin' cards, sent her rap message through a bottle
Lines from Dolomite, few tips from Goines
Birthday, gave her two 50 cent coins
Puppy love, gorgeous face, amazed by lip gloss
Cherry cent, when the princess spoked yo it bounced off
Mole like Marilyn Monroe, threw a rose in her mouth
Wherever God go will be Mrs. Coke

Girl's so pretty, kids with little niddys
Hope the years go slow, slow
Surrounded by intelligence, life through education
Healthy minds will grow, grow
Catch me on a bus-stop, dustin', cursin' out
The cops are still coming, vibe with me
Everybody's talking about Wu-Tang frontin'
But you still telling lies to me

Beautiful in light shows, having no intentions on love
But having strung eyes of oppose, here we go
It's not the way she bubbed the gum, shooked her ass
I'm not the one, double dus', waiting for the bus
The fagot Nore son, now year later
Lady 7th floor, building 7-80
Fancy fox, booties for her socks, nothing else can change me

Young Nefertiti, knowledge seed with no jewelry on
Tahitian fresh berry tree, she's a Capricorn
I really liked the girl, had dreams about her
Thinking to myself some nights she got
But hating, was Shinene and Grace and Key-lolo
Trick bitches jumped my boo at the school a few years ago
Hit me, you hit me, Grace got the last hit
Eh yo, these bitches started swinging and shit

So I jumped in
Those were the days, made faces in school plays
Paper trays, city wide test, made half a days
Shooting puppy water, might hump the pillow, dick a inch taller
Stapleton bum nigga, I pop a cherry for her
Fresh air fun, here's dunn, alphabets, berets
Jellies, bubble yum, soda tongue, too young to cum
Then engage him with them candy rings
Eh yo, I hit that shit, got jealous when she kissed Rob
I broked her chicko's sticks

Guys and girls, y'all remember those days and shit
Girls walk around in school, one ponytail with the beret
Next looking like baby powder
You know what I mean? Those were the days right there
Boston baked beans, girls come to school with mad candy
You know what I mean? You'd just come in school for half days
And all that
Just to see that little girl right there? In mind to this
Go home and think about it, you know what I mean?
May hump the bed sometimes on her, You know what I mean?

Word, those days man, those, those were the good old days right there G That shit was fun, lunchroom, see in the lunchroom
You know what I mean? Might get a little, go to the G.O
Store or something, you know what I mean?
Word, buy a little chocolate, a little shake or something
You know what I mean? A little Butter crunch joints or something
You know what I mean? That's that real shit, G I miss those shits, man
I wanna go back to school, man
That's my word, man
For real y'all, those were, those were the goddamn y'all you remember

Somebody get the God Kane, I know he'll back you up
Kick a rhyme spectacular, I think the Nigga think he Blackula
I seen somebody trying to get him with sunlight
Somehow it wasn't done right, then he just laced him with one bite
Go for the jugular vein, that's my new thing
How did you do it with two fangs, think they were gold like Wu-tang
Your luck has been changed, you're left strucken with pain
Well good for your ass kid, that's what you get for fucking with Kane.
I creep on MC's like po' nine and take rhymes the whole nine
to dig in you rappers like a coalmine
Now look what I dug me, somebody better turn me off or try to unplug me
Ooh it's starting to get ugly
Don't miss this, hold on with a clenched fist
As I tongue the microphone down just like a French kiss.
Relentless with lyrics that be brutal, hip-hop I stay true to
Put it on you like voodoo

Unda presha, niggas unfold and felt the heat
Possessed with the Brooklyn techniques we freak
Ay yo Kane, hit us off with that shit one time
They can't believe it, infatuated hardcore rhymes

When you diggin' out your girl from behind, you're gonna find
The reason that her eyes are closed, Black Caesar's on her mind
Your royal smoothness, honeys out there know how it goes
Even Cabesa de pollos that habla Espa駉l
Dig this now, run for your life to get away but none do
Even if you escape just tell me who can you run to
Test the, stupendous, tell me what was you to gain
Internal bleeding, due to Kane
Boom bow bow, ooh, the pain
Nobody's equal, keep it lethal, and diesel, to see to the people
And reach your cerebral cause that's how we do
The pain gets inflicted, fake MC's get evicted
Face it, truth of the matter is just that I'm too hard to get with
Since days of Pro Keds, I shined over mad heads, roll up on you like the Feds
Rip your whole set to shreds
A crash or a wreck, because I mash for respect
Only thing I want to know now, is this cash or a check?

Ain't no question,
I'm suffering a bad case of lyrical congestion
Not the one for testing,
come mess with and end up with your chest split
No, not because of cardiac, but because how hard he act.
I'm recognized as the microphone destroyer
Competition minds in the state of paranoia
I said if you're scared, get a dog
So by tomorrow you'll probably see 20 rappers walking with Rotweilers
Your gimmick is primitive, and impotent
You won't win with it so limit it
before I make your body start to hemorrhage
Just when you thought that you was burning me
You found yourself bleeding internally
Now you heads is l

Yo.
Saturday night, Uptown
Ridin past Kansas Fried Chicken
What's poppin kid? We in the mix
It's chilly 40 below
Gate's closed gotta catch Dr. J's
Blowin my hand, rub on my nose
Tap the glass, stop frontin Duke, fresh pair of jeans
Look I got loot, eleven in the Bass boots
Heard a screech pull up, these Jakes flashed me 5 pictures
One had my man's mug, Semi stepped brother hugs
You asked the wrong guy son
I'm from Melina, yeah we know Mr. Coles
Flew in two days ago to see his fam'
But we been watchin you, crazily
The whole Staten Island shittin on you
Wisdom Bird's pregnant out in Baisley
Hold up snow in your ear, fresh baldie tried to change up
Not trunk today, still lookin fly, still slammed up hung
Your mom pop in your trunk, slow your pace
Starks fixed your face, copped out the 6, five years probat'
You dealin with a lot of science, motherfucker we're watchin you
Make me wanna lick shots at you
You disgust me, screwin me down, grab my gun
Go 'head bust me, heard you hate Jake that's what it must be
Hands behind your back, spread your legs
Just found a roach in your tray
It's not mine fucker, what I said
You met the 13th nigga
A multimillion dollar operation is based upon it yo
Where in the Hell's the RZA?
He's sellin mics, wildest joints
Special made to go up in your hand and which went out on point
Switched to the next scene, I'm at the crib buggin out
on how po' live, hatin plus harassin the kid
Park the truck in the double face garage
Dial 1-900-Raekwon, tell the God shit's mega
Reel flashin me on BET, Planet Groove, Rap City News
NAACP committees. {*abruptly ends*}

Tic toc, this is how we rock
throw your hands in the air and do it for your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
throw your hands in the air and please don't stop 
Tic toc, this is how we rock



Tic toc, this is how we rock
we're those same  brothers that brought you "Chief Rock"
Now, um, underground's my style
to this I have vows
and I swear to my god
I'll always rock a crowd
So  peace to my area, N.W.K.
which is scarier
so if your on the deals, 
who cares, the more the merrier
Now right off South Orange
on the block of one-nine
of course, thirteenth ave 
is my stomping grounds
I open up my chest
and to my 'hood give my heart
'cause without the heart 
then your 'hood falls apart
So respect to the cement
the park called "the Corner"
'cause that's where the DOITALL TWO was performing
Runnin' from the cops
I couldn't be stopped
'cause i was jumpin' big gates that connected the blocks
Now before making records
the 'hood was my savior
but now I'm making tunes to make you jam wit 'cha neighbor...
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock


Well, I be the funk-ular
ultra-funk-ular
gamma-funk-ular
Half you rappers out there couldn't see me with binoculars
Anyone who thinks he'll take me out is just a dreamer
If you think you're the bomb, then I'm Hiroshima
When I die, 
I hope they're making records up in heaven
On a scale of one to ten, 
I'm like 100-5th-11
and sticks-and-stones-may-break-my-bones
but if you ever try to dis the Lords, then it's on
I go on beat...
off beat...
then jump right back on time
I drop another rhyme 
and talk about your fat ugly mama 
M.C.'s cannot rock me
I'm stone-proof
Me grabbin' the mic 
is like Superman running to a phone booth
Straight from Martin Luther King Boulevard
In the heart of Newark, New Jersey,
make you say "Lord have mercy"
If you step up in my face
then it's do or die
and I'M GONNA MAKE YOU CRY!  
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock



Well, times have changed
not only for the urban
but also for suburban
We get props, we're deservin'
From black kids, to white kids
I see them bob their heads, 
from the blond hair, to redhead
I even seen a dread
So now it doesn't matter 
as the clock winds down
with the tic and the toc
because they love the sound
But people 'round your area
say you sell out
because you sell a million copies
and your tour goes BAAAAOOWW!
So do it for yourself,
and do it for the 'hood,
but do it from the heart,
'cause that's when it's good
Now tell me what's gonna happen
after the rappin'
when the clock ticks away
and ain't nothin' happenin'...

.I remember way back in the days on my block
when the kids used to meet up in the hallway and rock
on Martin Luther King's boulevard
with P.C., WISE, EASY ED, and my brother HARD BERNARD
used to hit the ill rhymes from the head
while I'd hit the beat on the wall until my hands turned red
You had the SHORTY TWO M.C.'S, 
THE EDUCATED THREE,
I have to give them props for helping me be me
Now I'm the one who's educated
I suffered but I made it
I only write rhymes that will be appreciated
No matter how large I get
the fire still burns
'Cause from the 'hood I came
and to the 'hood I must return... 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and do it for your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and please don't stop 
Tic toc, this is how we rock
Throw your hands in the air and represent your block 
Tic toc, this is how we rock

Record spins, I'm going in
I don't shoot to kill, I play to win
Stay catching up with the cutthroats
Some men shoot a nigga, throw 'em off the tugboat, no floats
The body sinks to the bottom
Or left off the side of the road to smell rotten
The murder sprees, random killings
Ghostface Killah's back attacking villains, hanging from the ceilings
Godfather motives, gangsta mentality
Black superhero with the immortality
Forever, I be creeping in a black mist
I'll night vision with the militant tactics
I glide through the air like a swarm of bees
Shake niggas off quick like a dog with fleas
Raw meat, leave bodies slumped in the street
Revenge is the spice of life, it's so sweet
Ay yo, pipe bombs blowing they souls to Jesus
Don't need nothing but the puzzle glue for the pieces
Meat cleaver cut finger tips like rib tips
Home invasions, cars gonna flip, the mucous lose
Pair of cement shoes, tossed in the ocean
Popped until they brain ooze, I won't lose
Blood all on my apron, hog tie 'em up while they try escaping
Peeped the visual, tied 'em up individual,
Took their clothes off, season 'em like sausage
Let the pits out to eat 'em, that's the remedy
Attack, kill, bite off their extremities
Blood bath splash my name on my wall
Call it piece delivery, leave a tip on the stall
With an arm, leg, a head
I'm coming for you all
It's the sure shot
Heart of a lion
King of the jungle
I'm a humble killer bee
You as soft as a bumble
I don't crumble, I strike back hard with a vengeance
Attack through these killer words I spit in a sentence
I'm a menace, the black card cape, caped crusader
The face of a ghost, I disappear in the vapors
You could murder my flesh and bone, soul's invincible
Revenge my death, payback's the main principal
Protect ya neck when you move, I be lurking in the shadows
Starks, the gangsta nigga, I never lose battles
Pimp nigga, with a superhero logo on my chest
Big Gucci link, GFK on the crest
Icy arm for the eagle with the eight carat ruby eyes
Piss on your motherfucking arm while I'm stupid high
All black down, royalty purple and some ice chips
Two Glock 9s pointed at you in a hype flick
Now I'm alone in the room, and I just stare at the wall
Revenge my death but I'm going through with yours
My lost niggas, I miss them
This new power and wisdom
Got me thinking I've made a whole lot of bad decisions
Got locals still to deal with
Should I kill her?
Throw her ass in a cage with a gorilla
Or let her live and treat her like scum of the Earth
I've got goons to feed and babies to birth
I'm the God now, plus I'm a super rich nigga
Do more help than harm, either way you figure
Should I protect and serve
Or cock and aim destruction?
Let the enterprise take over the force of production
Corruption, my mind state is unpredictable
I'm bulletproof now, back from the dead, I'm invincible

Aiyyo, put your hands up, way in the sky
Light up your lighters, flame on the fire

Aiyyo I been on many stages of all sorts
Banged in many hoopties on blocks of all sorts
Ran to foreign ports, sippin on Port
Thinkin rap thoughts while I'm reppin for Newark, WHOAAAAAAH
Down-fall never, I rhyme too clever
Storm like the weathers, hip-hop for the pleasure
Feel the texture, how does DoItAll lecture
you and whoever, the more, the better
L-O-R-D, back from N-W-K
The U-N-D-A make me bounce this way
Why you say - here me from Chi to NJ

One day, that's when it's gon' come
For all you muh'fuckers, tell me where you gon' run to

Dearly beloved, we gathered here today to bust
Me and the Lords been in the lab, guaranteed to fuck it up - what?
If you got a problem with Jersey or Chicago
The revolver'll go POP and the weaves'll DROP
Rhyme-diesel heffer in it, don't stop, the glock cocked
Ready to penetrate with every one of my sixteen SHOTS
Don't be deceived by the pigtails, the butter colored ma
Smothered in cheese, the dopest bitch you've heard thus far
When in need, of an incredible high, you can flow
with the L-O-T-U-G and I, as we get lifted
til we die, all this stuff is weight
Make the money to buy the bank and the Benz and the vacation
 Take time to kick it with niggaz in Jersey
You weren't worthy and your day is comin
Motherfucker, you better keep runnin 
And that's all fact and no lie, one day got your name on it
Be ready to die

He took the words right out my mouth and walked a mile in my shoes
I've paid so many dues, I feel used and abused
And I'm... so confused
umm, excuse me, for example
I'm the inspiration, for a WHOLE generation
And unless you got 10 Sticky Fingers
Its straight immitation
A figment, of your imagination
But but but but wait it gets worse!!

Times was simply plain I knew they'd eventually change
Let's take a trip down memory lane
With the game talker, native new yorker
Gators on my feet, formerly british walker
Yes love, that's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Parlay with your crew at the corner store
Carrying a boom box 'til your arms were sore
We be wildin' on the corner free stylin'
Or politickin' 'bout doe we see piling
Or either girls we be getting with, how we be hitting it
Lying bout skins that we didn't get
Slow moving at paces through the rat races
The jordache look and fat laces
Making moves any type of way
I remember it like yesterday, hey

Chorus
Here's to you
That's how it was before
When you was funky fresh or down by law
Way back in the days how we used to do
Thank you for the good times y'all
Repeat

Verse 2
Déj? vu, things ain't nothing new
Shorties make me think how we used to do
When you couldn't be sleeping, if you plan on keeping
Hold of your sheepskin, heads do be peeping
Think it can't happen to you, now could it?
Came to school wearing puma's went home barefooted
And on the weekends when everybody click
To slide to the deuce to check karate flicks


Come back around the way after dark
So the crew could embark on the jam in the park
What would happen that night, was to scrap in a fight
Only way to break it up was playing rappers delight
And as I sit back watching you
Shorties out there doing what you got to do
I feel for you being sincere
Cause where you trying to go I already been there, yeah

Chorus

Verse 3
Ain't nothing but love I got to give
I don't playa hate cause we all got to live
That negative lifestyle I prohibit
Good life I got to live it, bubbly I got to sip it
Now I'll admit that I sort of be flashing
But yet and still I do it in an orderly fashion
Bring on the honeys and watch me mack these, stack cheese
Go on with your bad self, black caes
Just when the game got the stakes set high
Straight from bed stuy, the return of the jedi
With a jewel cause I'm tired of seeing
Charges being brought up, on brothers getting caught up
Now it's about time we connect, organize and collect
A new wold order's in effect
I send this out to the shorties in the hood
I wanna see you all live good

Chorus

You looking in the mouth of madness, skilled out since I had this
I'm talking bout nothing but pure d badness
My acceleration is compatible to a bima
My pockets looking greener, from the funky cold medina
Don't tell me bout the things that you done did cause I done did it
Don't tell me bout the skins that you done hit, cause I done hit it
And once I rock these, with a style that's cock deis
Good god, I get the crowd together like knock knees
Now, I don't act hard, I just mack hard
Baggin' video looking honeys with the big back yard
Yes lord, girls I'm gamin' leaving the microphone flamin'
Throwing up hip-hop signs cause that's the set that I be claimin'
Guerilla war fares for those who love to pull your card
Grimies from fort green to malcolm x boulevard
Now, if that's what you're hoping then it's the wrong things you're scopin'
I may not rap bout slittin no throats but trust me kid I'll get you open

Verse 2
Here comes a taste of the rawness, like you never saw this
Once I grip the cordless, my victory is flawless
Chaos and havoc, lyrically psychopathic
At times get pornographic, lord man I gots to have it
Then I commit to hit you with this composite that's ultimate
Too legit splendid come get wit' it for your comfort
But then sloppily, rappers try to copy me
Take pieces of my property, and use it all unproperly
And probably, been focusing a while to copy my style
But child what I'll compile is too versatile
I'm too superior, it's sort of like comparing a
Spanking new desert eagle to a rusty little derringer
But skip the tool, let's try to deal here with the jewel
That I'm droppin on you, now let me take you all to school
You see, to graduate in hip-hop you must be smart
And no you don't have to know how to paint to make your rhymes a form of art
Poetry and literature is what makes this english fanatic


Now dig this, I drop science but still deal with mathematics
And since I don't be dealing with what's considered a mystery
I learned the dead presidents to pass american history
Got my degree in rapology
Hip-hop had to set me free, look mom, a real emcee
So you want yours now, well don't get caught with your drawers down
Cause word life, this industry is half corrupt just like the dogg pound

Verse 3
Rap godfather
Oh goodness gracious, you better make it spacious
For the vivacious, ostentatious, who feel courageous?
I put it on them using my tongue as a sword
But at times get broader than broad for those who insist to get floored
Whatever it takes to see your nerve gone, and word born
Black caesar gonna get his swerve on
My name should be referred to in medical terms
Cause I get way up in the cut and I'm talking way worse than germs
You like to chase it playin catch like tom & jerry
But on the contrary, I'd rather sip the dom peri
Lay back in harmony, because it's so bizarre to see
That all the hard core rappers are slowly turning r&b
Well pardon me, you contradict yo'self, I see you not perfect yo'self
You like that type music yo'self, stick yo'self
What happened to black men of pride 'nuff men have died
Nowadays what's been applied, in hip-hop is genocide
That's when the rappers go get the clappers
Can't you see they trying to strap us just to trap us, good God it's backwards
One nation under a groove, that's how we move
It's time to teach the youth get it together show and prove
Me no run with the gun or speak of none for action
When you get done scream I'm the one, it looks like an illusion
I deal with equality so never call my brethren son
Yes mon, me got mad flava just like jerk chicken

Master!
*sounds of fighting*
Toad style. hmmph
The Shaolin deliberately tried to use the Lord
To learn our Wu-Tang sword fighting!
The Shaolin would never do that!
Wouldn't you? The Shaolin have always looked down at us
Are you afraid the Wu-Tang would become more famous than you?
You?
So you used your Shaolin poison to set up my master and deliberately frame me!
That's nonsense!
It's not nonsense! I saw it myself!
Nonsense! The Shaolin have nothing to fear from the Wu-Tang but our swordfight


Aiyo! Come on! Let go of the ratchet, son, come on, let's go! Come on!


Villagers, gangstas, pillagers, paintbrush
New whips, blue fifths, Louis Shallah, bitch
Ostrich turtlenecks, the Chef, already reps
Lean off the petty jets, we buy the very best
Outfits, powerful rich, pouncers, camel clips
One bump, two lumps, the shotgun, the new jumps
With flying bird, buying herb, new kick, designer birds
She on, and we up, let's re-up, and free'd up
Jakes hate it, Rae made it, Clientele, we gon' sell
You gon' starve, he gon' jail, night boots, swim with whales
Better snub, surgical leather gloves, never loved
We gon' kill, take it to the Hill, we forever real
Old records, old luggage, you ill with no rugged
You shoot and we spray, kill off them old buzzards
We love it, can't stand it, you read, the Wu Manual
We found it, stay grounded, we will, we still scrambling


Hold your fire!
You two traitors!
You've mixed the Shaolin and Wu-Tang
No, we have not, it's just that they're the same
That's right, my Lord
You misunderstand our kung-fu work
It doesn't belong to anybody, IT EVOLVES!
Kill 'em!


The wrist lifter, the grave sitter, baby sitter
The jobless, to open the vault, call your sister
The Pyrex, the up in the five, live as Twister
Blunt rolling, only a robe on, some whiskers
Knee slapper, the gat packer, blackjacker
Extortionist, friendly as shit, Bob and Back-lur
Ones folder over the stove, gold rover
The gear dresser, the chop bagger, Marvin Haggler
Rap stabber, eat you alive, gold tarantula
Sixteen paces and shit, hold the heckler
Pimp style, Axel Foley, stolen Rolly
All ya niggas that know me, ya'll owe me


I don't give a damn! Listen
Hahaha, And I'll kill anyone, who dares to go against

It's that number one hip-hop tramp, to get your thong damp
I put it down till you girls catch a cramp,
Take a little trip with the smoothest guy walkin'
Usually my fault in, girls wreckless eyeballin
Attraction is magnetic, they come and get it
Game is all natural, yours is synthetic
So while you sittin' there tryin' to get your words straight
I bag more dimes than workers at the herb gate
Use tight D, on top of tight G
Want it done rightly, girlfriend invite me
I foresee what you hoping,
And say the right thangs to get you open, then I get you open
Lay it down from nighttime until the A.M.
Watch how I play 慹m, lay 慹m and then fillet 慹m
In the kingdom I hit it like lottery
Baby you gotta see, the Brooklyn prodigy

Chorus
It's plain to see, your game is tight enough for me
I jus can't keep my cool, I just gotta let it be
And now you're in the zone
And I'm sure when you play on
That the way you put it down
Is gonna change this game around

Verse 2
Sharp P-I till I return to the essence
Making my presence, glow like florescence
I come around and get it like hot peas and butter
Drop these and got her, that Kane he's a mother
The God don't minimize, I enterprise, when I rise
In the thighs, make 慹m see doubles like geminis
So, bring it on me no sweat it
But you talk that Lil' Kim talk to me and end up bowlegged
Give it to you good upon the mattress
6 million ways to get yo' back twist
No theatrics when the Kane approach
Put you in more positions than a football coach
Pimpin' ain't easy but we don't knock it do we
Instead we spend chips, get fly, rockin jewelry
Walk through the club with the girls lockin to me
It's all love in here baby now sock it to me.

Chorus

Verse 3
I don't discriminate they come upon ease
Asians, Haitians, even the mommies
Please lowdown stankin', plus Jamaican girl bangin'
Them call me yard boy cause them seen something hangin'
Never do I waste that, I put my face at, a place that
In case I wanna taste that
Comfort specialist, is as easy as this
Ah miss, yeah duke you better hold your on to her wrist
I start roamin like car phones, and
Just can't control my hormones and
I make a move on a ten, and go and get a friend
So I can put my man in
While you sittin' there drinkin', that glass of Cris
I be sittin there thinkin', what's after this
Us two, me and you is what's happenin'
Bodily in heat like an African

Rappers stepped to me, but they didn't get none
I'm the Kane so you know the outcome
The microphone crooner, should have set the tone sooner
Hip hop to me Re boxing to Roy Jones Jr.
The genuine, search and you'll find
That on the microphone I can handle mine
Here's a view to a kill as I flipped the skill
When it's time to rock the mic like Al Scratch I get ill
I come equipped to fight and if I flip tonight
Effects on MC's are similar to kryptonite
Water flows that be hard to distinguish
It's best to relinquish, you don't want the God to bring this
I'm marvelous at the art of this, even if you got assist
stepping to me is a lot of risk. I release skills that's abundant
to explode and drop on you like flight 800

Keep it moving world renown
showing and proving
That we can hold it down

Here's a percentage of that old vintage
Macaroni flow but its mare than an image
Don't let the smooth taste fool ya, Let me school ya
On what it is, straight up square biz
Swift maneuvering to crush the crew you bring
Last thing them want tell me is Kane go do your thing who the king
Asiatic non equivalent to any
Plus I play the game a more harder way than Penny
The plan that I mobilize for dough to rise is no surprise
That it comes from what I vocalize
I'm the best you can get as I hit you with
The stroke of death And I ain't even broke a sweat
But this is where I draw the. line you're sure to find
Lyrics I be dropping is too much for the mortal mind
What's being caused is many MC's I'm seeing lost
The hip hop laws should be reinforced
You made a record this year, Oh you're hot
Something fishy about your style, who flow you got
You thought that you could hold me down no you're not
Now back up off me, here I come to blow the spot

Alright, here I come to get some
But instead you don't want the love to spread
I heard that jealousy and envy is a dum one's tool
so daddy says nothing he keeps his cool
I been through your tribulations and conflicts
Anything possible to keep me out the mix
But ease back, boy you better freeze that
Where my rivalries lack I'm still nice with these Black
I rap with the safety cap so that you don't get it twisted
And be another statistic
How many more to try, is sure to die
Slaughter I, all that playa hating only makes me fortify
to get the papers to me is a necessity
And I don't want a piece of the pie I want the recipe
I can't lose with what I use
I'm the reason why the lady sings the blues
Don't get it confused

See the crowd in an uproar acting unstable
Here comes dark gable raps remarkable
Mic ripper, cash flipper, cristal sipper
Derrie're batalliere that's french for ass whipper
Long time putting work in this, to be tremendous
If I'm not the best then I'm a damn striking resemblance
I roll the dice on the streets that be cold as ice
And cause great disturbance just like a poltergeist
I come attacking this enrage to disengage the missing page
To the newest in age that's hitting stage
For I be one that knows the art
To get you up and out your seat, if you was rosa parks
Tell me how much can you take from me the man to make
Rhymes that's so butter my breath smell like land o lakes
You know the lick, seen me hit em like a brick
Plus my posse run thick, not that click from mario flick
Beware of one of the best they be
You wanna test the God I hope you mean a sat
Because your poetasterous style it plain bore me
Pardon the vainglory, but here's the kane story

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo hands up to the sky

F**k the
And let the lyrics sit up in the track like rigamortis
I spit a few to listen to when this I do it's as if as you
Was invisible it'll make your life miserable
Hip-hop icon, keep a grip like a python
I be that wrong one to get fly on
Boy you got to get that playa hatin' out you
That's the other side of the game and I ain't erykah badu
Black caesar, don't you even reach my way
You'd sooner find a vital point that's on priest pai mae
I heat it up to where I pasteurize half the guys
A fast demise disaster lies as he dies
Confront one of the best at rhyming
What I write it be so rough that my ink pen need alignment

The untouchable, don't want to tempt me
I come kicking through your door, unlawful entry
It be me, even though none of y'all want to see me
For real, damn I know how jehovah's witness feel
I remember how I formed it up
Cause I took what was raw and then I warmed it up
Turned the fire down to simmer as I calmed it up
But take a look I think the kane about to overcook
Come and get it, but you better come with paramedics
Cause you couldn't bring it to me if you worked for fed ex
I come cutting through split his gut in two
I touch em what em do you know the style ain't nothing new

Bringing you that uncut pure, knocking at your door
About to give you more of the raw
Point yo' hands up to the sky, high
Get on down baby we keep it live
Repeat

A good game it lets the plot thicken,
But the thing that just ain't clickin'
Is the way y'all legalize trickin'
You talk about your ride and you don't even got one
But I can pull a hot one, when inside of a datsun
The wicked in the bed, plus the wicked in the head
When I shoot the game, it's like my tongue got infra red
Let the messiah take you higher as I supply ya' what you require
Desire and admire it entire
Sudden impact as I'm guttin' em black
Closest thing to me would be; nothin' in fact
I come with more in skill, to always score and kill
Females adore and thrill, sweeter thang than lauryn hill
As I return with a vengeance, here comes the day of independence
Approach them all with some bad intentions
In other words I'm making them resign, diminish mine
Runnin' through them like a finish line

Like the dead end kids we used to play in the streets
Never worryin about grief football spelled relief
Ronnie? was the coach for us
See he taught us to play almost every single day ok
Now on evergreen was larry and mike and lon
My cousin boo lived there too just to name a few
With sha rone he's bad to the bone boo's little sidekick
And a badass mouth he used to feist it on harmon street
With zach leo and ed
Me jody and boop by june, rocky and then comes
Tommy and cedric, lamont and greg, unique in our own right
At times we'd fight, but that's a-ight
Still, not realizin we had love, it showed
When we played, no phony charades against
One another, now while i write this song
It's like some are still alive and a couple are gone

* chorus * 
We're born to live, a life to die
Life's so damn short and i wonder why

As kids, you're overlookin death
It didn't seem important or serious, it just seems curious
It was about, wakin to a bowl of cereal
Cartoons on saturday's, karate flicks, and like
Ridin your skateboard, or bicycle
And went as deep as killa joe on the corner drinkin ripple
Plus, puerto rican kids on the block were cool
We got along, we all knew right from wrong
By far, we got a dose that life was hard
A spanish we were close with, was killed by a car
Shocking, alberto was hit, on the block and
Death was spontaneous, his moms was clockin him 'cross the street
He just received an award
For little league baseball like an hour before, plus

He didn't even get to see the summer set in
Dyin all young at the age of seven
It opened up my eyes small that the flesh was weak
As a kid, thinkin shit like that was mad deep, peep it

* chorus *

Now when somebody is gone, that's when you realize how close you was
How close you are. like a star
Real deep it takes time to heal
And still from time to time you wish you could find the way to forgive
And let him know you forgave
But they can't feel six feet deep inside the grave
What's left, but attend his wake, believin if it was you
He'd do it for old time's sake, damn
I'm disturbed, by the news when i was told i was sittin
Knowin damn well boo ain't bullshittin
My life flashed like big bills of cash
And good times we had, now it's all so sad
One of my childhood pals hit the road
When you take, to the streets, then you die, by the code
But in this case, who knows what went down?
Bottom line is wishin that he still was around
Now he found a spot in my heart, or should i say lobotomy
Mike, know you're trapped inside of me
And every other brother in bushwick
Who rushed to your side thick, all down with the click
Yeah, god bless he laid to rest
Call him mike boogie, that's what describes the nigga best


* chorus *

We're born to live 

Like that y'all

You lack the minerals and vitamins, irons and the niacin
Fuck who that I offend, rappers sit back I'm bout to begin
Bout foul talk you sqwak, never even walked the walk
More less destined to get tested, never been arrested
My album will manifest many things that I saw did or heard about
Or told first hand, never word of mouth
What's in the future for the fusion in the changer?
Rappers are in danger, who will use wits to be a remainder
When the missile is aimed, to blow you out of the frame
Some will keep their limbs and, some will be maimed
The same suckers with the gab about, killer instincts
But turned bitch and knowin damn well they lack
In this division the conniseur, crackin your head with a 4 by 4
Realize sucka, I be the comin like Noah
Always sendin you down, perpetratin facadin what you consider
A image, to me this is, just a scrimmage
I'm feel I'm stone, not cause I bop or wear my cap cocked
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock
Those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

 "Their time's limited, hard rocks too"

Speakin in tongues, about what you did but you never done it
Admit you bit it cause the next man gained platinum behind it
I find it ironic, so I researched and analyzed
Most write about stuff they fantasized
I'm fed up with the bull, on this focus of weed and clips
And glocks gettin cocked, and wax not bein flipped
It's the same old same old just strain it from the anal
The contact, is not com-pexed or vexed
So why you puhsin it? Why you lyin for? I know where you live
I know your folks, you was a sucka as a kid
Your persona's drama, that you acquired in high school in actin class
Your whole aura is plexi-glass
What's-her-face told me you shot this kid last week in the park
That's a lie, you was in church with your moms
See I know yo, slow your roll, give a good to go
Guys be lackin in this thing called rappin just for dough
Of course we gotta pay rent, so money connects, but uhh
I'd rather be broke and have a whole lot of respect
It's the principal of it, I get a rush when I bust
Some dope lines oral, that maybe somebody'll quote
That's what I consider real, in this field of music
Instead of puttin brain cells to work they abuse it
Non-conceptual, non-exceptional
Everybody's either crime-related or sexual
I'm here to make a difference, besides all the riffin
The traps are not stickin, rappers stop flippin
For those who pose lyrical but really ain't true I feel

 "Their time's limited, hard rocks too"

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Where do we start time apart, so many years so much heart
So many tears but still I couldn't cry them
Knew I was hurt but all I do is hide them
Wish you was here to see the places I've been,
I knew you would be proud to see the cars that I'm driven,
The home that I live in, I know that you listen'
But if you were here, I wonder would it be different?
What would it be like if I could add a few years
To the times she wasn't here to experience so you could see life
Man that would be like, changing the ending of a book that we like
But that ain't the story that I wish you would rewrite
Gotta keep going until they give me the green light
Livin' it up but still somethin' don't seem right,
Be gone in a physical but lifted my dreams like
Every night  and every day 
Every night  and every day 

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Even though it's a dream to me,
It still seems to be what I perceive to be perfect scenery
What if your lost could come back at a cost
But they told you the price would be whatever your fortune is
Would you spend it in a minute, for a minute,
For a second just to ask one question about how life is in heaven
I would give it all back, to the point of no return
Just to feel one hug, or to hear one word
But it's the same what we learn what to value
But we still mall when there's no one around you
But mama I miss you, one day I'll be with you
As long as I live you know you lifted my men too
Ill never forget you, you know that I love you
You know that I am the that I am because of you
Before I leave, you see, imma believe that you ain't in the flesh
You will come in my dreams
Every night  and every day 
Every night  and every day 

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye

Last night I had a dream and it felt so right
You held me in your arms and it felt so tight
And it felt so real, why would I wake up
I even day dream now, I don't wanna stay up
So you can take me to a place where I can go
And let my mind draw the picture that I control
Cause' I'm dreamin', yes I'm dreamin'
If you catch me asleep just leave me
Every night  and every day 
Every night  and every day 

Our love will live forever
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye
Our love will live forever 
Just one more word just one last kiss good bye 
Good bye forever, one last kiss good bye

Tell her with me it like a ride, a ride
But when the ride is movin' keep ya' hands inside
At first I take you low then I can take you high
Take you twice around the world, baby I make you fly

Make you fly, keep you laced Christian Louboutin
This roller coaster ride, she wanna do it again
But she can't 'cause she know I'm in love with the doe
Plus the ride that she's on is too emotional

I'm too stuck in my ways for us to play how we play
At first you beggin' to leave then you beggin' to stay
Same shit, different day, I'm like please civil play
You can lead if you may but then I hear you say

I'm so tired of playin' love rollercoaster with you
'Cause my heart can't take this drama you be puttin' me through
It goes up and down, round and round
Round and round, over and over again

I'm so tired of playin' love rollercoaster with you
'Cause my heart can't take this drama you be puttin' me through
It goes up and down, round and round
Round and round, over and over again

I never said it would be easy, peep the nigga you dealin' with
I be on my million shit, she be on that ill and shit
Whether club or studio she wanna know who I'm chillin' with
Ridin' on that rollercoaster none of us is feelin' it

The notion got me feelin' sick, I don't want to lose this
Money or relationship, please don't let me choose this
She's on a constant mood switch but I say there's no right or wrong
She swears that she's right, I'm wrong, she's always tryna prove shit

I be on that cool shit, she be on that bullshit
She says that I love her but don't love her like my music
Why do you think I do this to keep you in that new shit
Keep yo hands inside of the ride when it's movin'

I'm so tired of playin' love rollercoaster with you
'Cause my heart can't take this drama you be puttin' me through
It goes up and down, round and round
Round and round, over and over again

I'm so tired of playin' love rollercoaster with you
'Cause my heart can't take this drama you be puttin' me through
It goes up and down, round and round
Round and round, over and over again

This feelin' that I'm goin' through
You got me caught up and I'm so confused
And everything I thought that we had was true
But now I'm seein' a whole different side of you

You got me goin' up and down and round and round
I'm goin' up and down and round and round
Goin' up and down and round and round
And round and round we go

I'm so tired of playin' love rollercoaster with you
'Cause my heart can't take this drama you be puttin' me through
It goes up and down, round and round
Round and round, over and over again

I'm so tired of playin' love rollercoaster with you
'Cause my heart can't take this drama you be puttin' me through
It goes up and down, round and round
Round and round, over and over again

Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear


"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"


"Man down, where you from, nigga?"
"Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?"
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?"
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"


Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time, with the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shooting for if you ain't walking up, you fucking punk?
Picking up the fucking pump, picking off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from
AK's, AR's, "Aye y'all, duck"
That's what momma said when we was eating the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You moving backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess, m.A.A.d city


Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know, where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga


If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street I hear


"YAWK! YAWK! YAWK!"

Wake your punk ass up! It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. Real simple and plain, I'mma teach you some lessons about the street. Hood. It ain't nothing but a Compton thang, G-yeah. How we do


Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad
Sleeping in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking, the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
Kendrick, A.K.A. "Compton's human sacrifice"


G-yeah, cocaine, weed. Niggas been mixing shit since the 80's, loc. Sherm sticks, butt nakeds. Dip, make a nigga flip. Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit. One time's crooked and shit. Block a nigga in. Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton

I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by's in the hood lately
Couple of IVs with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause yeah, it's so real
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand


If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor, instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage, kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive, hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough
Compton, U.S.A. made Me an Angel on Angel Dust, what


M.A.A.d city
Compton

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn! You ain't the one that got fucked up, what you holding it for? Niggas always acting unsensitive and shit
Nigga, that ain't no word
Nigga, shut up! Hey, Dot, you good, my nigga? Don't even trip, just lay back and drink that

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long that
Even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how ya talking and where ya walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc'
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kind of g' that little homie's wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the street light

Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Keep spending most our lives

Living in a gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facing
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the stripes
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies is down, so don't arouse my anger, fool

Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away
I'm living my life do-or-die, uh, what can I say?

I'm twentythree now, but will I live to see twentyfour?
The way things is going, I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives

Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running but half of them ain't lookin'
What's going on in the kitchen? But I don't know what's cookin'

They say I gotta learn but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't, I guess they front
That's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives
Living in a gangsta's paradise
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me

Author: Dr. Dre

Yeah nigga, I'm still fuckin' wit' ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E
'99 nigga 
Still, still doing that shit, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out

It's still Dre Day nigga, A.K. nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga? My last album was "The Chronic" 
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still fuck with the beats
Still not loving police 
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease 
Still got love for the streets, repping 213 
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
 Hitting them corners on the lolos girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
 Hitting them corners on the lolos girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire till you're soaking in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin' Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through then I get skin, D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
 Hitting them corners on the lolos girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
 Hitting them corners on the lolos girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

It ain't nothing but more hot shit
Another classic CD for y'all to vibe with
Whether you're cooling on a corner with your fly bitch
Laid back in the shack, play this track
I'm representing for the gangstas all across the world
Still 
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king but the ace is back

So if you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre be the name still running the game
Still, got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't tripping, love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more living hard
Barbeques every day, driving fancy cars
Still gon' get mine regardless

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
 Hitting them corners on the lolos girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
 Hitting them corners on the lolos girl
Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Right back up in ya motherfucking ass
9-5 plus four pennies!
Add that shit up, D-R-E right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some with your dog
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky icky icky
Oooh wee! Put it in the air
Oh you's a fool D.R

Me and my niggas tryna git it, ya bish
Hit the house lick, tell me is you wit' it, ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish
Dreams of living life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish
Park the car then we start rhyming, ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You looking like an easy come up, ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

Dreams of living life like rappers do
Bump that new E-40 after school
You know "Big Ballin' With My Homies"
Earl Stevens had us thinking rational
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish
Another casualty of war, ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But I'mma purchase when that day is jerking
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skirting
Gang signs out the window, ya bish
Hoping all of them offend you, ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how I feel
Nah, nah, a dollar might just make that lane switch, that's just how I feel
Nah, a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how I feel

Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquor spillin', pistols popping
Baking soda YOLA whipping
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurking, blood
Bitches selling pussy, niggas selling drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me getting shaded under a money tree

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doing
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustling all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how I feel

K's Mom: Kendrick, just bring my car back man. I called in for another appointment. I figured you weren't gonna be back here on time anyways. Look, shit, shit, I just wanna get out the house man. This man, on one, he feeling good as a mother fucker. Shit, I'm trynna get my thing going too. Just bring my car back. Shit, he faded. He feeling good. Look, listen to him
K's Dad: Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol' fat ass. Girl, Girl, I want your body, I want your body, cause of that big ol' fat ass
K's Mom: See he high as hell, shit, and he ain't even tripping off them damn dominoes anymore. Just bring the car back

Yeah, what up Detroit
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh no he didn't
They didn't do it again
Wha-wha-wha-what?
You shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
Oh fo' sho'
Uh-uh, naw ya smell that, this is special right here
Wha-wha-wha-what?
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby
To the boogie-oogie-oogie
Aww yeah, y'know, what's crackin' Dre

Just let me lay back and kick some ol' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on "Guilty Conscience" at concerts
And watch mosh pits 'till motherfuckers knock each other unconscious
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard
When it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady, with Doggy from Long Beach?
Came a long way, to making these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre but I

Somehow, some way
Holla nigga, you know about Dogg-ay
Snoop Dogg
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where the fuck I'm coming from
I get the party cracking from the shit that I be spitting, son
Hit-and-run, get it done
Get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot, what'd you say it was, damn a nigga buzzed
Hanging in the club with my nephew Eminem
What up 'cause
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the King of the motherfucking West Coast, baby

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it 'cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with Gods
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standing over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch, please! You must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

Aww naww, big Slim Dogg, eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby, he's Shady
He's so crazy
Gimme the mic, let me recite 'till Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right, I'm just a criminal
Making a living off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like, and walk around flippin' the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a white kid from the burbs
Dreaming at night of screaming at mom, scheming to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is 'cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD using the "fag" word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
"Suck my fucking dick, you faggot", you happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club 'cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a 44

And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
That's the devil, they always wanna dance

2001 and forever
Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
Snoop Dogg
X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on!
Yeah

Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt

A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape

Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo 
Forget the telly we just go to the crib

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my carbon

I sit back and read, like Cat in the hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I
pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I
pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house,
wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at
the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing
Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled,
'Til your blood get spilled
I'mma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one. Savage, I ain't even hating."
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage, I was just playin'."
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on, man. Savage, you know I always play your mixtape."
Yeah, nigga, fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my carbon

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin', like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I grew up in the streets without no heart

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
'Cause I've been blasting and laughing so long,
That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you're talking and where you're walking
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke, fool
I'm the kinda G the little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night saying prayers in the streetlight

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the streets
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watching got me chasing dreams
I'm an educated fool with money on my mind
Got my 10 in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta set trippin' banger
And my homies is down so don't arouse my anger, fool
Death ain't nothing but a heartbeat away,
I'm living life, do or die, what can I say
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24
The way things are going I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's running, but half of them ain't looking
What's going on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front, that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool

Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Been spending most their lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise
Keep spending most our lives, living in the gangsta's paradise

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me
Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me

Xxplosive, West coast shit
My nigger-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying thank you cause they tell me, my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive, for my niggas drinking Cognac
Smoking weed, always pack

More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
West Coast shit nigga

Overdosage imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch

Eat a bowl of these bitch gobble the dick

Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up
Gobble and swallow a nut up

Shut up and get my cash

Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards and left stranded

Just pop ya collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala

Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala

Bitch niggas pay for hoes, just to lay with hoes

Relax one night, and pay to stay with hoes
Captain 'Save-'em-all-day', well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hitting pussy or hitting the switch
You into hitting bitches all for the grip
You punk bitch
All my real doggs still kick it with me

All my down hoes still tricking with me
All the true gangstas know

Nate ain't never love no ho
All the hoodrats still shake it for me

All my true fans still checking for me

All the real smokers know

Nate ain't passing nothing but dro indeed

Real trees, chronic leaves, no seeds
When I met you last night baby
Before I blew your mind
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more, now that I'm sober you ain't that fine
Don't wanna treat you wrong
Don't wanna lead you on
Here baby hit the bong
While the West Coast rolls along
While we, still making gangsta hits
You'll be, still jocking gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you're slick?
Somebody better get this bitch, this bitch
I got these freaky hoes
Clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bonafide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowing the ho for four days, pimping repays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, fo' real

Author: Dr. Dre feat. Eminem

Y'all know me, still the same ol' G
But I been low key
Hated on by most these niggas
Wit no cheese, no deals and no G's, no wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles and no ski's
Mad at me
'Cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries

Got a crib wit a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies
But y'all think I'm gonna let my dough freeze
Ho Please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the OD's?
Eazy-E's, Ice cube's and D.O.C's and Snoop D O double G's
And a group that said, "Muthafuck the police"

Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in you hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the doc that he told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or the Firm flop
Y'all are the reason Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fuckin' around wit me
And turn me back to the old me

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish

And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study your tape of NWA
One day I was walkin' by
Wit a walkman on

When I caught a guy givin' an awkward eye
And strangled him off in the parkin' lot wit his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a dodge
But I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humungous truck in a two car garage
Hoppin' out wit two broken legs, tryna walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops

Imma kill you and them
Loud ass muthafuckin barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through me
Dre stood next to a burnt down house
Wit a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out
From here on out it's the chronic two
Startin' today and tomorrow's the new

And I'm still loco enough
To choke you to death wit a Charleston chew
*chigga chigga chigga*
Slim Shady hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up
And the temp goes up to the mid 80's
Callin' men, ladies

Sorry Doc, but I've been crazy
There is no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailey

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre

If it was up to me
You muthafuckas would stop comin' up to me
Wit your hands out lookin' up to me
Like you want somethin' free

When my last C.D. was out you wasn't bumpin' me
But now that I got's new company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of The Compton
I told em all
All them little gangstas
Who you think helped mould 'em all?
Now you wanna run around and talk about guns
Like I ain't got none

What you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off
What 'cause I been in the lab wit a pen and a pad
Tryna get this damn label off
I ain't havin that
This is the millenium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap
You can have it back
So where's all the mad rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Knew that I was strapped wit gats
When you were cuddling a cabbage patch

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish
And muthafuckas act like they forgot about Dre
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips
Just a buncha gibberish

Yeah, what up, this is Dr. Dre
The party's goin' on
Thank God it's Friday

Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!
Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!
Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!
Buck buck buck buck booyakasha!

Keep their heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong

Hey you! Sittin over there

You better get up out of your chair

And work your body down

No time to funk around, cause we gon'

Funk you right on up
So get up: get a move on and get your groove on
It's the D-R-E the spectacular
In a party I go for your neck, so call me "Blacula"
As I drain a nigga's jugular vein
And maintain to leave blood stains, so don't complain
Just chill, listen to the beats I spill
Keeping it real enables me to make another mil'
Still, niggas run up and try to kill at will
But get popped like a pimple: so call me Clearasil
I wipe niggas off the face of the Earth since birth
I've been a bad nigga, now let me tell you what I'm worth
More than a stealth bomber, I cause drama
The enforcer, music floats like a flying saucer
Or a 747 jet, never forget
I'm that nigga that keeps the hoes' panties wet
The mic gets smoked once you hear the beat kick
With grooves so funky, they come with a Speed Stick
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong

1, 2 for the crew, 3, 4 for the dough
5 for the hoes  6, 7, 8 for Death Row
Mad niggas about to feel the full effect of intellect
So I can collect respect - plus a check
Now I fin' to get into my mental
Will take care of this business I need to attend to cause my rent's due
And this rap shit's my meal ticket
So you god damn right: I'm gonna kick it or get evicted
I bring terror like Stephen King
A black Casanova, running niggas over like Christine
When I rock the spot with the flavor I got
I get plenty of ass, so call me an ass-tronaut
As I blast past another nigga's ass that thought he was strong
But I smoke him like grass, just like Cheech and Chong
When I flow, niggas know it's time to take a hike
Cause I grab the mic and flip my tongue like a dyke
I got rhymes to keep you enchanted
Produce a smokescreen with the funky green to keep your eyes slanted
So check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

Debonair with flair, I scare wear and tear
Without a care, running shit as if I was a mayor
But I ain't no politician, no competition
Sending all opposition to see a mortician
I'm up front, never in the backdrop
Step on stage and get faded just like a flat-top
Your rhyme sounds like you bought em at Stop 'n Go
Dre came to wax you, so just call me Mop 'n Glow
Many tried to, but just can't rock with
I'm 6'1", 225, I'm pure chocolate
Your chances of jacking me are slim, G
Cause I rock from summer until Santa comes down the chimney
Ho ho ho, and so, as I continue to flow
Cause yo, I'm just a fly negro
So, check the flavor that I'm bringin'
The motherfuckin' D-R-E will keep they motherfuckin' heads ringin'

Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Keep their motherfuckin' heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Keep their heads ringin'!
Ring ding dong
Ring-a-ding ding ding dong
Yeah, uh, come on!

If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down
If you want to get on down
You gotta get on down
Just get on down

Unfadeable, so please don't try to fade this 
But uhh, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let em understand

And before me dig out a bitch I have to find a contraceptive
You never know she could be earnin her man
and learnin her man -- and at the same time burnin her man
Now you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it
 And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this and like that and like this and uh
Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Well I'm peepin, and I'm creepin, and I'm creep-in
But I damn near got caught, cause my beeper kept beepin
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seatbelt
You never been on a ride like this befo'
with a producer who can rap and control the maestro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know, and I know, I flow some ol funky shit
to add to my collection, the selection
symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue

on what me and my homey Snoop Dogg came to do

It's like this and like that and like this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this

And who gives a fuck about those?

So just chill, til the next episode



Fallin back on that ass, with a hellafied gangsta lean
Gettin funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh yes I'm fresh, N double-O P
D O double-G Y, D O double-G, ya see
Showin much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin hoes and clockin a grip like my name was Dolomite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin G shit

 So Dre 
Gotta give em what they want 
We gotta break em off somethin 
And it's gotta be bumpin 

It's where it takes place so when asked, yo' attention
Mobbin like a muh'fucker, but I ain't lynchin
Droppin the funky shit that's makin the sucka niggaz mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close, and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, cause if I slip, then I'm slippin
But if I got my Nina, then you know I'm straight trippin
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I'll have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop

I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on, to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N, and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., "No One Can Do it Better"

Like this, that and this and uh
It's like that and like this and like that and uh
It's like this
And who gives a fuck about those?

Regulators
we regulate any stealing of his property
and we damn good too
But you can't be any geek off the street
gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean, earn your keep!
REGULATORS! MOUNT UP!
It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
just rollin in my ride, chillin all alone
Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
on a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
all you skirts know what's up with 213
So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
some brothas shootin dice so I said "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said "What's up?"
some brothas pulled some gats so I said "I'm stuck."
Since these girls peepin me I'ma glide and swerve
these hookers lookin so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix
I'm gettin jacked, I'm breakin myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
they took my rings, they took my rolex
I looked at the brotha said "Damn, what's next?"
They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down
They got guns to my head
I think I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin in my own town
If I had wings I would fly
let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate
Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
now they droppin and yellin
it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate
I laid all them busters down
I let my gat explode
now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
if you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb
Now Nate got the freaks
and that's a known fact
before I got jacked I was on the same track
back up back up cause it's on
N A T E and me
the Warren to the G
Just like I thought
they were in the same spot
in need of some desperate help
the Nate Dogg and the G-child
were in need of something else
one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "ooo I like your size."
she said "my car's broke down and you seem real nice
would ya let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
the next stop is the Eastside Motel
I'm tweaking
into a whole new era
G-Funk
step to this
I dare ya
Funk
on a whole new level
the rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble
Chords
Strings
We brings
Melody
G-Funk
where rhythm is life
and life is rhythm
If you know like I know
you don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
funked out with a gangsta twist
if you smoke like I smoke
then you high like everyday
and if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

Hit a opp up, dreads swangin' just like I'm a Rasta
Smokin' ganja and I'm zooted, walkin' in my Pradas
Any nigga test my gangsta nigga, I'ma pop 'em
And we ain't throwin' hands with you fuck niggas
It's one up top up in that chamber, better duck nigga

For you niggas think I'm pussy, you gon' have to show me hoe

Police always at my fuckin' crib, I don't tell 'em shit

Before I Left, I Hit The Bac-Ardi
Went To Her House To Get Her Out Of The Pad
Dumb Hoe Said Somethin That Made Me Mad
She Said Somethin That I Couldnt Believe
So I Grabbed The Stupid Bitch By Her Nappy-Ass Weave
She Started Talkin Shit, Wouldnt You Know
Reached Back Like A Pimp, Slapped The Hoe
Her Father Jumped Up And He Started To Shout
So I Threw A Right Cross And Knocked His Old-Ass Out

Coz The Boys In The Hood Are Always Hard
You Come Talkin That Trash, Well Pull Ya Card
Knowin' Nutin In Life But To Be Legit'
Dont Quote Me Boy Coz I Aint Said Shit

"Who Do U Think You Are Mr. Big Stuff"
"Rock This Muthafucka Like The Hard 3 Tha Hard Way"

I'm Rollin Hard, Now Under Control
Then Wrapped The 6 Fo' Round A Telephone Pole
I Looked At Ma Car And I Said "Oh Brother"
I'll Throw It In The Gutter And Go Buy Another
Walkin Home And I Seen The G Ride
Now Cat Is Drivin, Kilo On The Side
As They Busted A U, They Got Pulled Over
A Undercover Cop In A Dark Green Nova
Cat Got Beat For Resistin Arrest
He Socked A Pig In The Head For Rippin His Guess
Now G Is Caught, For Doin The Crime
Fourth Offense On The Boy, He'll Do Some Time

Coz The Boys In The Hood Are Always Hard
You Come Talkin That Trash, Well Pull Ya Card
Knowin Nutin In Life But To Be Legit'
Dont Quote Me Boy Coz I Aint Said Shit

L.A. Playa
Big Drum Beater

I Went To Get Them Out But There Was No Bail
The Fellas Caused A Riot In The County Jail
Two Days Later In Municipal Court
Kilo G On Trial Cold Cut A Fart
Obstruction Of The Court Said The Judge
On A Six Year Sentence, Ma Man Didnt Budge
Baliff Came Over To Turn Him In
Kilo G Looked Up And Gave A Grin
He Yelled Out Fire, Then Came Suzie
The Bitch Came In With A Sub-Machine Uzi
Police Shot The Bitch But They Didnt Hurt Her
Both Upstate For Attempted Murder
Coz The Boys In The Hood Are Always Hard
You Come Talkin That Trash, Well Pull Ya Card
Knowin Nutin In Life But To Be Legit'
Dont Quote Me Boy Coz I Aint Said Shit
"Yeah, I Kicked A Little Ass
But That Was A Blast From The Past Muthafucka
"Get Busy Ya Ya Ya Yall"

And Monte keep it on him, he done dropped niggas

And if you ain't a ho, get up out my trap house

You talking cash dog, I goes all out

Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case
But I ain't beat that case, bitch I did the race 
Beat it up, where I nut? Shorty face

Pop a nigga then I go out my way 
Do the dash then I go out the way
Rob a nigga shoes, rob a nigga lace
We tryna see a hunnit bands in our face

Fuck a beat, I was tryna beat a case

Gotta go dat way, you get robbed for your wreck-aids

Migo gang 30 deep, walking in the party
I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming "gnarly"
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul

Now lay me down to sleep, pray the lord my soul to keep
Hundred band juugs, I did a week
Fuck what you say don't judge me
It's niggas that sin every day, do whatever that go get the cake
Some niggas they go move the weight
Some niggas they just got make it shake
My life is a movie, my niggas they gooning
Put 100 bands in their face, my nigga baffooning
That mean they go get it, the money, the power, respect
I know that you dig it, my niggas is eating it
Bap Bap Baow, no witness, no forensics
When I pull up in that audi thing, your bitch get in it
I ain't being friendly, no pretending
Me and Rel Money, we be balling just like Mike Finley
I pull up on a bitch, hello kitty
Sipping lean, I'm leaning
Hoes say I'm silly, stacking money to the ceiling
Young Quavo, I'm different
Yeah, I just signed for a milly
Kra Kra Kra, banana peeling
Gone!

Migo gang deep in the building
We flooding your city, Katrina, call FEMA
These bitches is fucking and sucking like leeches
The world full of devils, I wear Jesus pieces
I'm walking with cash, I don't carry visa
My bitches are Asian like Tila Tequila
I'm whipping them babies, my wrist illegal
And I keep the seven, I play with the Eagles
The water so cold, y'all finna turn fold
Like you at the top just to get to the gold
I'm draped up in gold, like a pharaoh
I ride the phantom, like I'm a ghost
Pull out the MCM bag, got faces
Ride in the Bentley, they said I wouldn't make it
My diamonds are Asian, I'm selling Caucasian
Walk on the block, the block is Cajun
I'm smoking like I'm a Jamaican 
Bitches gettin' their slavin' 
Bad city Baltimore, it's the Ravens 
Think you gon rob me, boy you crazy 
BITCH!

Aye yo' name must be Ray Allen or somethin'
You got game nigga
Fuck yo' game; I got wrist game

I just bought a Bentley wit' my wrist game
Earn my plug trust wit' my wrist game
Fuck a calculator, I got wrist game
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game

Built a house wit' cocaina I'm livin' like a eskimo
Pull up on Tito, he posted at the local corner store
He need a half a bag, remixin' wit' half a swag
Don't hit my phone, won't talk to you, no need to call me back
Whip game, hurricane, feelin' like Bruce Wayne
Ice chain from Johnny Dang, diamonds kickin' like Liu Kang
Naked bitches in the kitchen sniffin' off of dishes
Got them Thanksgiving turkeys, Quavo sellin' whole chickens
Servin' patients like a clinic, runnin' bands up at Lenox
Quavo President Clinton, selling Monica Lewinsky
I might pull up on you wit' the birds in that 'Rari engine
When them plays come my way, I might catch it like a mitten

When you got wrist game you can get anything
Gold chains, bought my index a Versace ring
So much coke in my trap spot, the pot's hot
Money jumpin' out my shoe box like Jack Box
Bitches whippin' in the kitchen, bra and panties off
Never think 'bout juugin' cause they know I cut they fingers off
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells
Flats in my panorama, watch me change the channels
All these damn babies, use saran for the pampers
Change my name to Tetris cause I got so many blocks
In the trunk I got two blocks I might just pull up on yo' block

My whip game it is so crazy get them bricks from them boys in Haiti
Cocaine and water create it, in the kitchen I'm making them babies
Yo' closet filled wit' Old Navy, my closet filled wit' old babies
I'm whippin', I'm whippin' them pots in the kitchen, you know I be gettin' I'm flippin' them benjis
Run wit' the pack then I'm cuttin' yo' throat, before I buy coke, I gotta get quote
Breads by the loads, bring 'em on boats, I fly overseas I'm doin' the most
No lie, I will take a oath, finesse the plug, it's time for a toast
I started wit' 'bows and started wit' grams and now I'm sellin' them wholes
I feel like John Gotti, them bricks in my Masi
Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
The feds keep talkin', they say I'm a target
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
You know I got bucks but not from Milwaukee
It's never a drought, it's bricks on the market

With so much drama in the L.B.C.
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day

May I kick a little something for the G's?
And, make a few ends as I breeze through
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
'Cause my momma ain't home

I got bitches in the living room gettin' it on
And, they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do? Shit, I got a pocket
Full of rubbers and my homeboys do too

So turn off the lights and close the doors
But, but what? We don't love them ho's, yeah
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie
She used to be the homeboys lady

Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, 'cause you gets none of these

At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Bitch, I'm just

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homey
Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke

I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton

To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you ho's, I'm out the do' and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, bitch

Things just ain't the same for gangsters
Times is changin, young niggaz is agin
Becomin O.G.'s in the game and changin
To make way for these new names and faces but
The strangest things can happen from rappin
When niggaz get wrapped up in image and actin
Niggaz get capped up and wrapped in plastic
And zipped up in bags when it happens, that's it
I've seen em come, I've watched em go
Watched em rise, witnessed it and watched them blow
Watched em all blossom and watched em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money? I lost them both
Went and visisted niggaz in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show 

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' 
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' 
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know 
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low 

I moved out of the hood for good - you blame me?
Niggaz aim angry at niggaz they can't be
But niggaz can't hit niggaz they can't see
I'm out of sight, now I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggaz wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot if niggaz wanted you shot
I ain't a thug - how much Tupac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch neither
It's either my life or yo' life and I ain't leavin - I like breathin
Cause nigga we can go round for round
Clip for clip, shit fo'pound for pound
Nigga if you really wanna take it there we can
Just remember that you fuckin with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you, remember that
When you wanna come and fill these shoes 

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' 
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' 
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know 
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low 

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggaz in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we raised in
Then they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
Cause everytime you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now we got a new era of gangsters
Hustlers and youngsters livin amongst us
Lookin at us, now callin us bustaz
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin thanks I get?
It's funny how time flies
I'm just havin fun, just watchin it fly by 

Everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' 
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' 
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know 
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low

Explosive, West coast shit
My niggerish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causin' me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them all
Now I'm sayin' thank you cause they tell me, my shit's the bomb
Explosive.
.for my niggaz drinkin Cognac, smokin weed, always pack
Mo' than one firearm, chrome rims, ridin' on
Chronic in yo' system, let me know, my shit's the bomb - explosive.


West coast shit nigga
Overdosage - imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch; don't tease bitch, strip tease bitch
Eat a bowl of these bitch, gobble a dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick can shut the fuck up!
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash
Backhanded, pimpslapped backwards and left stranded
Just pop ya collar, pimp convention hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce impala
Pimpin hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas paid for hoes, just to lay wit hoes
Relax one night and paid to stay wit hoes
Captain Save'Em all day  well save this dick
Bitch nigga, you more of a bitch than a bitch
You ain't into hittin pussy, or hittin the switch
You into hittin bitches off of the grip, you punk bitch


All my real dogs still kick it wit me
All my down hoes still trickin wit me
All the true gangstas know
Nate ain't never love no hoe
All the hoodrats still shake it for me
All my true fans still checkin for me
All the real smokers know
They ain't passin nuttin but dope indeed...
Real trees...
Chronic leaves...
No seeds...

When I had you last night, baby
Before - I blew yo' mind, 
I thought we had a chance, lady
No more - now that I'm sober you ain't that fine, hmmm-hmmmhmmmm...
Don't wanna treat you wrong, don't wanna lead you on
Here baby, hit the bong, while the west coast rolls along
While we - still makin gangsta hits You'll be - still jockin gangsta dicks
Damn girl you think you slick, somebody better get this bitch, this bitch


I got these freaky hoes clappin they hands, stompin they feet
Every now and then they put they mouth on me
Nowadays a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimpin bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player, nowadays it pays the B
Lemme drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave ya boy the head and said don't let nobody know
A bona fide pro, I had to grab the hoe
She got freaky in yo' sixty-fo', I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin the hoe for fo' days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the mote'
They be beepin me and shit, but we don't kick it no mo'
Them hot hoes is fiendin, they own the nuts
But bitch, I'm out ya pussy when I nut, f'real

Smokin this, drinkin that, hittin it hoes
Fuck this I'm hittin that I'm hittin em both
Have one ridin dick, one lickin my toes

No hugs, no kisses, bear rugs, bear britches
Rare bitches like to pose in them Black Tail pictures
Bitch jumped off my dick, "Is that Dre over there?"


Yeah -- I just took some Ecstasy
Ain't no tellin what the side effects could be
All these fine bitches equal sex to me
plus I got this bad bitch layin next to me
No doubt, sit back on the couch
Pants down, rubber on, set to turn that ass out
Laid the bitch out, then I put it in her mouth
Pulled out, nutted on a towel and passed out


Come on let's get high

While a bitch is better off to masturbate and be out
All you bitches up in here know what I'm talkin about
Get the loot, get the ice, fuck the wife, no doubt
Tryin to live lavish, marry a big dick and stay carried
Holla back at them niggaz that hollered at me
Pop the Cris', whip the six and shit
and have all y'all niggaz limp when I twist my shit
Yeah! Bitch ass niggaz!

What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

Back when cube was rollin' wit Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' wit a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business, but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you

But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we've been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cuz you my nigga doc, and eazy I'm still wit you
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you, and that's just bein' real wit you
You see the truth is everybody wanna know how close me and snoop is
And who I'm still cool wit

Then I got these fake ass niggaz I first drew with
Claimin' that they non-violent talkin' like they
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same
Nigga, it ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

Yo I stay wit it
While you try to perpetrate, play wit it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it

I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby sited
I smash you critics like a overhand right from riddick

Come and get it, shifted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow points at each and all of you


A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid, never come down
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they soul train laminates
What's the difference between me and you?

About five back accounts, three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath till ain't none left
Yo that's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

Aight, hold up hold up
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fuckin' weed is in me

I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfuckin' back, just know this shit
Right? Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga let's blow this bitch
I mean it dawg, you ever need somebody offed who's throat is it?
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is

Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around wit her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people then drop her off on the corner

At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off and beat you wit the piece it was sawed off of

Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up, mucus in hot water
That's for tryin' to talk like the chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the doc's brought up!
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, "I just don't give a fuck" and see who means it

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal wit emotions
I'm used to livin' big dog style and straight coastin'

What's the difference between me and you?

This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P.
A message to God.

Since you finishin' him early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow, later we'll regret 'til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other.
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last 'cause my better half is up there wit you
You knew what you was doin' when you made us; so with all due respect
You could've forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him 'cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it. Who you think put me in it?
I'm feelin' like my whole world is blinded
Wonderin' why I'm cryin' pourin' out my heart, pourin' out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, somethin' we never should do
We could've used time spent arguin' tellin' the truth
He had talent too, I had plans on watchin' him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seein' him leave or watchin' him go.

Listen listen listen...  whoa oh oh 
Listen listen listen...  whoa oh oh.
Listen listen listen... {*harmonizing*}
Listen...

+ {Mary}
If you wonder why... {why I live my life}
The way that I do... {'cause I got to get this money}
So don't worry about me... {'cause I know my way around}
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper.

Youse a soldier, your probably packin' heat up there
Met up with homies from the street & got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm goin' through it wit you
We lost a thug, a son & a father
I spoke to your son the other day & told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pullin' your file
'Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit or you gon' play 'em like you get it
I done been through all emotions from in shock to keepin' a poker face to straight breakin' down & showin' all emotions
From anxious to believe in real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizin' I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'm a always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died wit you.

Listen listen listen...  whoa oh oh 
Listen listen listen... whoa oh oh
Listen listen listen... {*harmonizing*}
Listen. eyy-eyy-eyy-yeah-yeahh.

+ {Mary}
If you wonder why... {why I live my life}
The way that I do... {'cause I got to get this money}
So don't worry about me... {don't worry, don't worry}
I'm just hustlin' everyday, runnin' this race, makin' this paper.

Yeah, yeah, ahhh-oooh-oahahahhhhh. listen.
mmmmmmmmmhmhmhmmmmmm.
if you don't know why I. you gotta listen up right now
lis-ten, lis-ten, lis-ten, lis-ten.
oooooooooh... oahahoooohhh ooooha ohhhhh
lis-ten, lis-ten
ahhhowooooo yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
yeah-ehh-yeah, yeah-ooeooooh
yeahhooooohahhooooh listen
lis-ten, children lis-ten
I'm tryin to tell you somethin good
Don't get caught up in the hood
Yeahhh-hah, yeahhh-hah, aooooooh
if you don't know why.
you gotta find out the reason why.
brother. brother.

I got mo' class than most of em, ran wit the best of em
Forgave the less of em, and blazed at the rest of em
What can I say? Cal-i-for-ni-A
Where niggaz die everyday over some shit they say
Disconnected from the streets forever
As long as I got a baretta, nigga, I'm down for whateva
I roll wit my shit off safety - for niggaz that been hatin me lately
and the bitches that wanna break me
If Cali blew up, I'd be in the Aftermath
Bumpin gangsta rap shit, down to blast for cash
Cause from Eazy-E, to D.O.C., to D.P.G.
started from that S.O.B., D.R.E.
Like Dub-C I'm rich rollin, pistol holdin
Pockets swoll nigga, that's how I'm rollin
Put the flame to the killer nigga
Worldwide homicide mob figure and a builder, for real
I'm hittin switches, makin bitches eat bitches
See me grab my dick everytime I pose for pictures
I own acres, floor seats watchin The Lakers
I'm cool with eses who got AK's in cases

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal

Haters hate this, we sip the Mo' and yank the heezos

I bust a Mr. Toughy, slash a Smoothy Doobie
Crash and flex on Tuesday's, harassin hoes at movies
Passin by with uzis - and who you aimin at?
That shady bitch and that bitch nigga that was claimin that
Rat-ta-tat-tat I don't sympathize for wack hoes and wimpy guys
You got to recognize Hitman is a enterprise
Cali pride, born to ride and South Centralized
The Henny got me energized - smoke the guys
tryin to focus on mines - poke they eyes out
I'm L.A.'s loc'est - hope they don't have to find out the hard way
like snitch niggaz in the pen that get
hit when the guards look the other way
We hittin HARD, Hitman and Dre
You playin games, I suggest you know the rules
We puttin guns to fools, make you run yo' jewels
Take yo' honey and cruise to the snootiest snooze, Cabos
Pop coochie til the nut oozes, you shouldn't fuck wit crews

that's sick, Aftermath cause we rule shit
I'm Big Hit, don't confuse me wit no other by the flow motherfucker

Dedicated to all of those with big ego's
Never fakin, we get the dough and live legal

If the head right, Ricky there every night
Joey I was listenin'
pullin up spinnin' rims
Time to spend some dividends
My money they swimmin' in
Ross, I'm a boss  I'm the mayor 
Make it rain , on these haters 
Get your umbrella fella, cause we blowin'
hella chedda, I'm the nigga that you scared of
Cause no one can do it better

...
Joe Crack girly
80s crack baby's momma paid me

Maybach, fly Mercedes
Twerk that, drop it baby
Them perty ladies, they drive me crazy
Them skies is hazy, I'll pop like 80
Somebody tell Mr. Bentley to bring his umbrella
Katrina not, its just a one fella
Who got dumb chedda, and need a brain surgeon
Got me a designated thrower, cause my hand's hurtin'
I make it rain, its coca bitch

It's not a game, them Vatos Locos rich
Ain't nothing wrong with wanting a little happy ending
And we don't need a hotel, we parkin lot pimpin'
Bitch!
Yeah, I'm in this bitch with the terror 
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain 
I'm in this bitch with the terror
Gotta handful of stacks, better grab an umbrella
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
I make it rain, I make it rain, make it rain on them hoes
Hey ya, hey ya, take me, take me down with you
Hey ya, hey ya, take me, take me down

M-m-m-m-a
No, no, no, no, no, no
These hoes, they like niggas that spend money, not talk about it
If you ain't gonna get the money then watcha gonna do?
Hey!

I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed pedico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I made a million on that, I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

Young rich nigga, I flex, look at my neck
Look at my bitch, look at my wrist, got these niggas upset
Who you know blow a mill? Don't even think twice, no sweat
And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can't hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angels bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a purple, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
3-57 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than na
And if they act like they ain't with it

I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed pedico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I made a million on that, I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get the cock
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dade-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top
Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass in stocks

I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed pedico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I made a million on that, I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

Ugh, Double M, bang!

Get it right Terio
Ooh, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

You ready? You ready?
I don't think they is

Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...


Let the beat come back and the streets come back
Niggas on the west tryna make the east come back
Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like

And a nigga fuck around get the RICO Act
Shoot shoot, and one, where my free throw at?
And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats
Like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em

They know Meek Milly, I barely went gold
But Meek Milly look like he sold two million
All this new money I'm getting my nigga
I swear I don't know what to do with it
Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers
I really don't give a fuck who with 'em
Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time
And ya'll forgot about me
Acting like I don't really want mine
What the fuck wrong with em
Know how we feeling, let me get back to it
Terio like ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em
Ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh kill 'em, ooh

You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked, nigga
You fuck around get smoked

Uh, niggas know the rules in my hood, if you touch me, you get murked
We ain't with that back and forth, it ain't no rap, we hittin' first
G-5, we be at LIV by Sunday when you in the Church
Momma stresses, selling dinner platers, tryna get your casket, and get ya hearse
Last nigga that slid on us, got dropped on it, he told on us
Every nigga you see with me got ice on 'em, bank rolls on us
Naw, nigga no 1 on 1's we don't fight fair, we just roll on 'em
V-S stones and cuban linx, all that ice wear with that gold on 'em
We ain't swinging no flag, nigga
We ain't need no pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a 30 clip and laser on it, play tag with us
Everybody wanna talk bricks 'till them feds, swoop in and grab niggas
Dream chasers got into something, we don't never bleak cause we trash niggas
I don't know if y'all heard about my homie doing that 30 out
Deen Buck still in the cut and stay fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin' 'bout that other homie that you heard about
Cause if he heard about the truth, run your mouth
He come to your house and start swervin' out
Catch me in Y-C, out Shadyville, I'm in the tank
Only time this Manhattan when I'm in the booth or I'm in the bank
Summertime in La Marina with Dominicans going in the paint

Pullin' up screamin' Dimelo catch you in Brooklyn, get pita rolled puss!

You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked, nigga
You fuck around get smoked

Thirty-six... pyrex... bakin soda... I make a nine stretch
Paper towel, let it dry it
Got'em lookin at my wrist like, "Is he signed yet?"

For the right price I could make it straight drop, right price
Try, make a lot, lot. Stack em pots, ta ta fuck ya'll on

Bitches on my dick, make em bounce these dudes that I'm with cause they be gettin down like a muhfucka, like the muhfuckin ground yeah lay a nigga down in tha muhfuckin ground it's a muhfucka, that's what muhfuckin happen with my clip. uuuhhh! We really rollin, I said I'm really hoe'in

And I done see these bitches do it all for the paper
And I done see this paper turn my dog to a hater
For the love of the money, the love of the dough
For the love of the money, them hoes fucking for sure
And I know, And I know
Who said that money isn't everything?
Whoever told you that they a damn liar
Cause all this money, it can buy you everything
I don't know nothing that money can't buy

I ain't never sinned, I ain't ever crossed over
Gotta go to Panama, I don't want it chopped up
Everywhere I go I'm pulling up burners
The first to get the money, drop some, murder something
Defend this code, the feds all delivering
Yeah, I fuck with Papi, but no, I ain't Dominican
For the love of dividends, spin around the block
I let them know I got it cause he out there round the clock
In the projects jewelry mean you made it
And the body might get you famous
And the key might get you stopped
Fuck with me, I might get you opp
It's no apology, nigga, it's criminology, nigga



And I ain't never jealous, and I don't get emotional
Its all about familia, I do what I'm supposed to do
Talking up boutique sales, tying up the loose ends
Know me from the project, They used to go "yo who that"?
Copped all my mixtapes, you tryna roll up
You heard I was moving shit, wait a second, hold up
Be careful what you say, They tryna get inside, the phones, they got ears
They also got eyes, you know
You break it down and you get a watch
Be breaking down and we get them blocks
Cause if you play around getting guap
We gonna lay you down, get a mop
We sigh, we grind and we here
No, everywhere, every day, ever route
Every smoke that we light and it's on
Lets Go

Author: Meek Mill

You know one thing I hate...
It's when a person come up to me or... I hear somebody say "it must be nice"
You know my answer that... is "you must me a hater"
Tell me why you mad fo'
Listen Luda, we gotta keep it real boy
We gonna do it like this baby
Listen here, you know what I'm sayin'?
Tell me what they mad fo'; come around the hood
See us sittin' there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo' cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo'

Time to start putting grown-ass men on time out
Go to the corner and cry somehwere man
Old insecure ass nigga; yo' heart pump Kool-Aid man
What you mad at me for - Luda!

Is it cause I got houses on every coast
Or that I'm on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
While they're blowing that smoke, I'm blowing a couple million makin' a killing stunting on impostors
Only rapper in the game with a Grammy and an Oscar
7-figure movie deals, 8 figure bank runs
And I'm still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got I've already drove
Any chick that you hit, my nigga I've already ho'd
Say it with your chest like these diamonds on my charm
Name on my headphones, label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say "Ludacris is insane"
That niggas daughter's birthday's the tail number on his plane
Fuck with me but nobody's fucking with me
Taking a shot of my cognac, more millions - real G's chug it with me
If I'm happy there's no reason you should be sad for
So will somebody, can somebody please...

Tell me what they mad fo'; come around the hood
See us sittin' there looking good
Tell me what they mad fo' cause you be on the radio
Sounding like you made a million dollars
Tell me what they mad fo'

Ha! Is you niggas hating cause you mad
Or is you mad cause you hatin'?
Choose one, hater

Now if these niggas hating on me I'mma kill them dead
If I wasn't rapping I'd be probably be in the feds
In the cell, getting mail, with a million dollar bail
But instead of counting blues, I'mma take this YSL
And this Gucci, and this Louis, Prada cause I'm hotter
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina Iguodala
I beefs up in my Beamer, check aboard my collar
And when I check my bank account, I'm checking for them commas
I'm like all these niggas haters, all these bitches fucking
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothing
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stunting
And you nigga still talking all this money shit you bluffing
You bluffing, you bluffing, I really think you bluffing
100, 000 dollars man them bottles we just crush 'em
Now tell me why you hating? You hating cause you mad?
Or is you mad because you hating, boy you sad

Haha, look, yeah
Ok, I see why you mad, I'm countin' all this money
And I'm popping all these tags, hoppin' to it, fuckin' bunnies
Real nigga, one hundred, you tryin' to do it, I done it
I spit sick on this rap shit, make them sick to they stomach
I'm clean man, you hate, mad cause I'm gonna keep it real with a real nigga
I got racks on racks, and a black Maybach - call it black on black cause I kill niggas
In the club all girls, no niggas don't talk to me cause I ain't really trynna hear niggas
In the coupe it's the truth and the roof go poof, vamoose, I can make it disappear nigga
See this the type of shit that I be sayin'
Just because I'm balling, that don't mean a nigga playin'
Haters can blow me like a fan
Flyer than a bitch, I don't think I'mma ever land
But in the meantime, baby what's your plan
You can call me daddy but I can't be your man
Fiending like the addicts, when I pull it out they panic
Bitch I do damage, you gonna need an ambulance

Showtime...
Put one hand in the air if you know somebody
That's mad at you right now for no reason

Riding around in my jeep, bumpin' that 2pac
I'm walking around in my hood, cocked back two Glocks
98 in my status, I came back I'm the baddest
Christian's on my feet, I told you I'm the baddest
All the way in Paris, don't talk you'll get embarrassed
My watch is fuckin', yeah you get embarassed
500 hunnid on them racks, pulled out them stacks
Niggas talkin' crazy, drop top Maybachs
My life is just ludicrous, sucka you just new to this
430's pullin' up; goddamn we do this shit
Chickens and the waffles, chillin' in the villa
Bumping Ludaversal, gettin' that scrilla

Yuuugh!
Hey Luda, you know why these haters mad for right?
The truth shall set you free

If you sellin' all the records and you fuckin' all the bitches
And you sit a top of the charts and you livin' out your wishes
With your chains all smothered and your watches all glittered
And your ghost and your phantoms all comin' home to visit
Or maybe cause your bitches was never really your bitches
With your baby mama fucking every rapper in the business
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid, is you skatin', is you dissin'
Found out your Ghost leased and your Phantom just rented
Won't need it in your name like Pac when he went missing
Makaveli lives on so I'm riding on you bitches
Hail Mary be the witness, Lord Willin' I was dealing
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Bullseye, be the motherfucking target for this killing
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?

When I was broke as a joke people used to hate on me
Now I'm on I don't need your money
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Back in the day shawty wouldn't 
Now its hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright

Shawty I'mma be alright
Now you all on my dick back then you was all on Peter's pipe
You ain't used to  but when you see me you be  twice
Have the nerve to tell me I look good and now you see the ice
See the fame speak my name
Little hoes just being hoes
Being  when I was locked them little hoes ain't even write
 coldest nights living at the speed of life
Thinking when I touch I'm going to fuck them hoes and feed them right
When I was broke my nigga  put me on
Hit me with that hundred and forty-six and 
And I was gone
Nigga I ain't never look back
And I've been getting to the money ever since you heard that

When I was broke as a joke people used to hate on me
Now I'm on I don't need your money
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Back in the day shawty wouldn't 
Now its hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright

Shawty I gon be ok don't worry about me
I don't need a bitch for shit
Just some pussy and some lips
Pull up whips, think a while ago I was loosing
Now these hoes try to hop up in that Rover while its moving
What you expect money, power, and respect
Know I'm gon be ok as long as the boy he got his 
Know that Gilie don't write checks
I don't give a bitch shit
Old school like Ice Cube bubblicious and some dick
 at the higher got a suite
With about 7 or 8 freaks
And I know these bitches sweet
Talking bout they want to eat
Dick until we skeet skeet
Like the Ying-Yang twins
But we won't give them no ends

When I was broke as a joke people used to hate on me
Now I'm on I don't need your money
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Hommie I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Back in the day shawty wouldn't 
Now its hard for me to keep shawty away
But shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright
Shawty I'mma be alright be alright be alright

They used to tell me tough luck
My gear was all fucked up
My sneaks was all scuffed up
Until I came to fuck up
Baddest bitches here  I probably fucked her
And now these niggas flipping bricks couldn't even get with this
T.I.P told me the same bitches that the boss is fucking
Gon be fucking you now long as you go harder youngin
Told him it was all or nothing
Fuck them hoes don't call or nothing
Cause when I'm in the studio I'm tryna make a movie ho

I be going hard for that
Peso, peso, peso, peso, peso, peso
I be going hard for that
Peso, peso, peso, peso, peso, peso

Shit, I be goin' hard... 
That's right... 
Get money... 
That's right... 

Kells
I be going hard for them pesos
Came from the bottom made a milli
Squad move when I say so
Gotta bring them dollars to the city
Muthafuckas thought I wasn't living
Daddy thought I never could've did it
Now my hood see that Wahoo fitted on the TV screen next to Diddy
Praise God for my brothers
I'll rob for my brothers
Cause when times was hard I flipped that pack like somersaults for my brothers
And I never ride with them suckers
Dick hard for my bitch
And without me half of these rappers wouldn't exist, shit I be going hard for that...

My taste level on Ace level
Spade nigga for a paid nigga
We darkskinned, south of France
All acting like Jay nigga
Jetski and I'm jetlagged
Still smelling like jet fuel
That PJ split three ways, 60 making that jet move
My pesos from Play Cloths, Pyrex from Pedro
Tags pop from Pucci to Paul Smith to Penrose
Been down, that's ten toes
Score nigga, that's endzone
Ask me I sell dope, N-O from this Benzo

I'm getting paid when I wake up cause I hustle hard before I go to sleep
And now I got my cake up, I'm balling hard like I'm suppose to be
Got bad bitches tryna roll with me
White bitches like "totally"
V.S. stones all over me
And I'm killing niggas no first degree
Cause I'm going hard for that peso
Selling blocks no lego
Got killers all on my payroll
And they shoot like O.J. Mayo
In the coupe, pull up like "hey ho"
With the top down on that bitch
And when they cat scan my body it was dollar signs on that bitch, whoa!

Body Cass, put 'em in a body bag
Broke nigga, we should put you in a bodycast
Real nigga, all I know is get a lot of cash
I took you hater niggas spot that's why you prolly mad!
My story, all guts, glory
Posted on the corner, Glock. 40 tucked on me
20 years on me, me and my army
Feelin' like none of y'all niggas can harm me
I came from the bottom where they never make it at
With all my jewels on they ain't never takin' that
There's rules to the game I ain't never breakin' that
And once you give a statement, nigga, you can never take it back
You lame part of the game, nigga pardon the fame
I got 30 in my clip I can park in your frame
Plus this Rollie on my wrist cost some cars and change
We talking bike life, 'bout to put a park in my name
Just to ride on you niggas, or slide on you niggas
G550 when we glide on you niggas like
Clyde on you niggas, homicide on you nigga
I ain't never had no rap, had no ties to you niggas, so
Why you suckas hatin' and talkin' 'bout what I'm makin'?
When I be out in Jamaica and ballin' like I'm like a Laker
It's givers and it's takers, these niggas is gettin faker
And I'm just gettin' richer I wake up and get my cake up!
Black Maserati, chinchillas from Papi
Ten killers beside me, all lookin' like ahkis
I remember nights on corners with beef and broccoli
Rice and gravy, now it's crazy cause Phillipe's got me
All gold ap, same watch as Jay-Z
Ballin' like I'm kd, how can niggas play me?
If you ain't talkin' money nigga fuck you, pay me
Drophead with the top down and the A. C.
On, drawn, fuck is y'all doin'
I'mma king you a pawn, lil nigga I'mma Don
The coke price high, it cost 40 for a jawn
And like 20 for a half lil nigga do the math
And you talkin' bout a battle rap, how you gon' handle that?
100 grand pussy nigga, you ain't got the tab for that
You ain't got the stacks for that, you the one we laughin' at
You ain't got half of that, they pump you up: Asthma attack
Bye clown, calm down 'fore you make me bomb now
Fucking all these superstars like "Who Meek Milly bomb now?"
Went from driving Bentleys to going half on pie pounds
You niggas need to die down, Philly nigga: my town
I heard your car got re-poed
But this is bike life boy you just got Deebo'd
You in the field tryna turn to God like Tebow
Naw that won't work nigga, that'll get you murked nigga
All-black Ghost nigga, looking like a hearse nigga
Been a dead man, so I'mma dig you out the Earth nigga
Just to stuff your skeleton right back into the dirt nigga
What you made this year? What you worth nigga?
I dropped "Dreams & Nightmares, " I made church nigga
I did "I'ma Boss, " youngin' set the summer off
Man these old niggas mad at me cause they fallin' off!
Ha! Get your hate on Cass
And we ain't talking larceny cause they all trash
And your goons ain't riding witcha, they all mad
Cause you ain't never put no food up in ar abs
My dog killed a body for ya, damn he didn't eat from it
Now you mad at Swizz cause you can't get a beat from him
Once my niggas coming at you dog, we gon' keep comin'
We ain't no Forest Gump nigga, better keep runnin'
D. C. Nigga, you P. C. Nigga
While you was scared, I was eatin' chichi nigga
Talking to Tip about how we gon' beast these niggas
All I know is bang bang, like that Chief Keef nigga
Got a matte black Aston, gold rims on it
Bitch looking like it got a pair of Timbs on it
Cashmere sweater, bunch of Jims on it
All my guns come with extends on it
Duck? And hit up, tuck nigga you lit up
Cause you looking like food my youngins ready to get up
Call you for a verse and tell you to write some shit up
Boom, high stick up, jumping all out the pick up, woah

…Man, whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo, turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone…
Fuck it, just shut up and listen, ayo

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress
That's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me
I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patience is in me
And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be, it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant
And, Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, ‘cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at? And look where it's at!
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem ‘cause I rap this way
But I'm glad, ‘cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians
Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black
‘Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
Till I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
‘Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it
I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom
Without someone standing by it
No, I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, ‘cause…

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
‘Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, every day I am
I don't know, it's just the way I am

Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her

Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers

I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows

That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles

I think about more than I forget
But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat

And these niggas know I lay them down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg

Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes

Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic

Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"

I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away
Man, I come down in a couple of days

OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode

I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code

It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode

All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole

So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down

No love lost, no love found
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

You kicked me when I was down

But what you say, just 

That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get 

You show me nothing but hate

You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around

I don't need you 

You 

That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get 
Bitch you get 
And I don't need you

Get 'em

I'm alive again

More alive than I have been in my whole entire life

I can see these people's ears perk up as
I begin to spaz with the pen,

I'm a little bit sicker than most
Shit's finna get thick again

They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit,

now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again

Caution to the wind, complete freedom

Look at these rappers, how I treat them
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em

They call me a freak cuz
I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them

Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage

Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?

Snatch the mic from him,
bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute

Yeah the rap is tight
But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um

Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit

And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference

When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
In the place all the way to the parking lot,
fellow

Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal

Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
I so started to rock fellow

When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow

Til I'm toppling from the top
I'm not going to stop

I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop
'Til my hip don't hop anymore 

When you so good that you can't say it
Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore

People just get sick cause you spit

These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride

You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow

You'll never take my pride
Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent

Is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless

I smell blood, I don't give a fuck
Keep giving them hell

Where was you when I fell and needed help up?
You get no love

It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down

But what you say, just 

That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you

Bitch you get 
You show me nothing but hate

You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around

I don't need you 
You 

That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to
see you

You get 
Bitch you get 
And I don't need you

Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check one two, we recording?

I'm cancerous so when I diss you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangle you to death then I choke you again
And break your fucking legs till your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me, I'mma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown, 'cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono
So if I said I never did drugs, that would mean I lie and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet
My nerves hurt, and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads
Every girl I ever went out with has gone les
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people and drink
Jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignorin' skill
'Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill

But I don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist

How the fuck can I be white?

I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave, die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave

My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?

And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?

Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

I slap women and eat 'shrooms then OD
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?

Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer that'll spray a aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped
I'm running out the morgue with your dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on

And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm about as normal as Norman Bates with deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late

Mother, are you there?
I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel

Will someone please explain to my brain that I just severed a main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain?
I take a breather and sigh, either I'm high or I'm nuts
'Cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am I

So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
'Cause when I drop this solo shit, it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it

I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've been with 10 women who got HIV
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably want to grow up to be just like me

Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Wildin' for wallet
Kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner
He was wishin' for a burner
To kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Fuck bitch on BET
Have her walkin', she fuckin' for BET
Wildin' for wallet
Kill everybody walkin'
He knows that his soul in the furnace
Tiimmy, Tiimmy, Tiimmy Turner

Woah, uh get your hands in the air
And get to clapping 'em and, like, back and forth
Because this is what you thought it wasn't
It be's the brothers representin' the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man, he goes by the name of um, er…

Slim Shady, brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80, you little like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin', Dirty Dozen, naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gon' sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it, while we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
"Hi, Marshall!"
I have a disease, and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
'Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swingin', so fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding, just ask DeShaun Holton

I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck

'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

I'm nicer than Pete, but I'm on a search to crush a milkbone
I'm everlasting, I melt vanilla ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezin'
Flavor with no seasonin', this is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you, smell the Folgers crystals
This is lyrical combat, gentlemen, hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials
Extortion, snortin', supportin' abortion
Pathological liar, blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker, compulsive drinker, addict

Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack

I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you finna get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

Somebody let me out this limousine! I'm a caged demon
On stage screamin' like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinnin'
Clinically brain dead, I don't need a second opinion
Fuck droppin' a jewel, I'm flippin' a sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfuckin' style, just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure, I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitchin' while I'm washin' dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam, that's when my face grayed

Went to gym in 8th grade, raped the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke, I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snortin' coke and smokin' weed again
I'm going up over the curb, driving on the median
Finally made it home, but I don't got the key to get in

So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming "Fuck the world" like Tupac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back
Dirty macking, telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck

So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
'Cause you gon' get stuck, stoned, and snuffed
'Cause I just don't give a fuck

Shit, fuck everybody!
Outsidaz
Pacewon
Young Zee
Fuck the entire world!

There is no escaping
There is no place to hide
you scream someone save me
but they don't pay no mind
You're walkin' down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin' and your in a
Nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner
Waitin' for you to turn the corner

So he can corner ya', you're a goner
He's on to ya', out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run, all you want is to rest
'Cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again
Swallowing the Calotapin
While I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn holding onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it, wake up naked
At McDonald's with blood all over me
Dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must've just blacked out again, not again
It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em

I said
Its 3 AM in the morning
Put my keys in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got here
But i guess i must've killed 'em


Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon, I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find Hannah Montana

Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin

Bust all over the wall paneling
Dismantling every candle on top
Of the fire place mantle and grab my flannel
And my bandanna then
Kiss the naked mannequin man again

You can see him standing in my front window
If you look in, I'm just a hooligan who's used to
Using hallucinogens, causing illusions again
Brain contusions again, cutting and bruising the skin
Razors, scissors, and pins, Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who, gave these molecules to me
What am I gonna do? Hey, the prodigal son
The godfather for one
Very methodical when I slaughter them
It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em

I said
It's 3 AM in the morning
Put my keys in the door and
Bodies layin all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got here
But i guess i must've killed 'em

She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin

I cut and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half-pint of a Jack
My last vic and a half, a flashlight up

Kim Kardashian's ass, I remember the first time

I dismembered a family member, December
I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinking tub
Cut him up into pieces and just

When I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta' drink his bathwater that oughta' be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run

A secret passageway around here, man
There's got to be one, oh no, there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs
But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up

It's 3 A.M. in the morning
Put my key in the door and
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must've killed 'em

Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old
Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart
And suddenly, his conscience comes into play

Alright, stop! Now before you walk in the door of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You'd better think of the consequence
"But who are you?"
I'm your motherfuckin' conscience

That's nonsense
Go in and gaffle the money and run to one of your aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blonde wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades

Yeah, but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it, before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older then George Burns

Fuck that, do that shit
Shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit?
Are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies?
Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?

Man, don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
Not over this shit
Stop!
Drop the biscuit
Don't even listen to Slim, yo
He's bad for you

You know what, Dre?
I don't like your attitude

Meet Stan, twenty-one years old
After meeting a young girl at a rave party
Thing's start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom
Once again, his conscience comes into play

Now listen to me: while you're kissin' her cheek
Smearin' her lipstick, I slip this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe...

Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair

Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot bare
Till she passes out and she forgot how she got there
Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie "Kids"?
No, but I seen the porno with Son Doobiest!
Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dawg and bail

Meet Grady, a twenty-nine years old construction worker
After coming home from a hard day's work
He walks in the door of his trailer park home
To find his wife in bed with another man

Alright, calm down
Relax, start breathin'
Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheatin'
While you at work, she's with some dude, tryin' to get off?
Fuck slittin' her throat!
Cut this bitch's head off!
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
What? She tripped? Fell? Landed on his dick?
Alright, Shady
Maybe he's right, Grady but think about the baby, before you get all crazy
Okay! Thought about it
Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did
Be smart, don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes!?
What'd you say?
What's wrong?
Didn't think I'd remember?
I'ma kill you, motherfucker!
Ah-ah, temper, temper!
Mr. Dre? Mr. N.W.A? Mr. AK, coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way?
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
'Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that
Aw, fuck it, what am I sayin'?
Shoot 'em both, Grady, where's your gun at?

I'm a fucking walking paradox
No I'm not threesomes with a fucking triceratops
Reptar, rapping as I'm mocking deaf rock stars
Wearing synthetic wigs made of Anwar's dreadlocks
Bedrock, harder than a motherfucking Flintstone
Making crack rocks outta pussy nigga fishbones
This nigga Jasper trying to get grown
About 5'7" of his bitches in my bedroom
Swallow the cinnamon, I'mma scribble this sin and shit
While Syd is telling me that she's been getting intimate with men
 Here's the number to my therapist
 You tell him all your problems, he's fucking awesome with listening

Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang

Jesus called, he said he's sick of the disses
I told him to quit bitching, this isn't a fucking hotline
For a fucking shrink, sheesh, I already got mine
And he's not fucking working, I think I'm wasting my damn time
I'm clocking three past six and going postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock nines
This ain't no V Tech shit or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
 I slipped myself some pink Xannies
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fucking broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
 Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbing 'em
I'll crash that fucking airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver?
Green paper, gold teeth and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds and bitches, don't need them
But where the fat ones at? I got something to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fucking leaves
It's been a couple months, and Tina still ain't perm her fucking weave, damn

Wolf Haley, Golf Wang
Wolf Haley, Golf Wang

They say success is the best revenge
So I beat DeShay up with the stack of magazines I'm in
Oh, not again! Another critic writing report
I'm stabbing any blogging faggot hipster with a Pitchfork
Still suicidal I am
I'm Wolf, Tyler put this fucking knife in my hand
I'm Wolf, Ace gon' put that fucking hole in my head
And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved the cock in your bitch
 Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just want to know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' Goblin
 That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit, dead

Straight outta the muthafuckin' crib, ho
On 128th, me and Slim, doe
Dead broke, we were smoking mid, bro
Baby mama hollerin' "How we suppose to live though?!"
Fuck that! Beat the game up quick, though 
Everybody in the team eating
Green meals, green leaves, it's the green season
Catch me on Lee, up at Sharks eating
Whippin' with the hot sauce like I'm street leaguin', And1 though
On the porch getting cut though
On first block with the blunt rolled, me and Dub-O
My city, my city
Been turned up from the jump tho

Throwing hands in the hall on the first day
Scared of one of my hoes gettin' knocked up
Snatching purses in the mall, getting locked up
Bitch, I needed paper, I needed paper
Dreamin' of the penthouse on the elevator
The hood taught me don't talk, just walk mine
Timbos on the curb by the stop sign 

East Side, West Side
Cleveland for life
East Side, West Side
Uptown to down the way
Uptown to down the way
EC to the Heights, all day

Bitch, I'm from The Land till I die  till I die

Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whip lash

Aaaahhh, I'm a muthaf-cking monster!

I-I crossed the line-line
And I'll-I'll let God decide-cide
I-I wouldn't last these shows
So I-I am headed home

Man I hate rap, but if the shoe fits, wear it
I've become a freak of nature all the kids stare at
Who walk around bumping RAW with the shit blaring
Saying "Fuck school" and dropping out like a miscarriage
I'm embarrassed
And I'm ashamed I played a part in this devilish game
Making your common sense perish
But I ain't taking the full blame
Cause most of you chumps running around here ain't never had strict parents
All of your brain cells rotting from weed
You feeling like if you ain't got it, life's not as complete
You having sex with every-motherfuckin'-body you see
With a past so dark that Satan'd jump out of his seat
But still you out in these streets thinking you hot as can be
Without the knowledge to lead so you just follow the sheep
Making sure your lame swag is all polished and clean
While your favorite rapper's like "Yeah, he got it from me"
You been brainwashed by a fake life that you're used to livin'
When I say the word "fun", what do you envision
Probably drinking and smoking out with your crew
And chilling with clueless women you trying to bang, bumping New Edition
Is that all you think life really is
Well if so, then you're a fucking idiot
I honestly feel like grabbing your head and hitting it
Matter of fact, you don't even deserve a brain, GIMME IT!
Do you even have any goals
Aside from bagging these hoes and packing a bowl
Well let me guess- No
You're only in school because your parents make you go
And all you do is play beer pong and hang out with your bros
Yo, society's got you living for a whack cause
You're a fucking adult with no skills at all
You don't read any books or play ball
You don't draw, you literally do nothing at all
Still you fiend for the glamorous fruits
You don't have cause you idolize rappers that do
And all they say is "I got money and it's stacked to the roof"
And now you think that it's gon' magically just happen to you
How, Your lazy ass don't commit to labor
You pick something up, try it out, and put it down two minutes later
Then you complain about your life cause it ain't getting catered
Now whoever tries to call you on your bullshit's a hater
You wanna succeed, you have to try
Or one day you'll get older and regret it all cause you can't provide
Your friends are lowlifes, don't act surprised
Look, just cut the bad fruit off of the tree, make the sacrifice
Girls, stop acting like you want a guy with traits like Romeo
Bitch that's a fucking lie
You always talk about how every man's fake
And you can't take it and you want something real
Shut up tramp, save it
Twice a week you put on your makeup and damn bracelets
And head to the club half-naked with your ass shaking
Pulling a lowlife nigga who claim he cash making
Til you let him hit and find out he work at the gas station
One of them niggas got you pregnant and you can't raise it
But you caused it, your actions made a fat statement
You want Romeo, then act patient
And stop fronting like he in the club posted in the back waitin'
It's the club, where guys put on a new persona
After they get loaded with a few coronas
They always shouting and wild out with habits that very few condone of
Then they look for beautiful brainless bitches like you to bone 'em
Then when they leave you, you cry and cry
Talking 'bout
"Oh my god I can't find a guy
I've spent so many years and I've tried and tried
Why am I even on Earth? I should die"
You want Romeo, you're not worthy
You're cock-thirsty
You're nasty and probably got herpes
Sometimes the secret to find is to stop searching
Try a new formula, cause your last one's not working
The term "real nigga"'s publicly used
And I need to know what it means, cause I'm fucking confused
Are you one for always busting your tool
With nothing to lose and something to prove to homies up in your crew
Is it because you're selling drugs to get loot
And brag about how you done been shot and stabbed
Like it's fun to be you
But your life's a struggle, right, and you just hustling through
Nah, you hamster ass nigga, you just stuck in a loop
Man, why do black people gotta be the only ones who can't evolve
Cause you in the streets acting like a neanderthal
It's clear you can't stand the law
you're lost as an abandoned dog
And all you're interested in is fighting, rapping, and basketball
I can't even fuck with you, cause if we out in public
You gon' get caught stealing some shit and get my ass in trouble, too
You'll get old and be nothing
Living life in these streets
thugging and starting shit with anybody mean mugging
Look at you, a real nigga, thinking your life's cool
Girls used to turn me down for guys who were like you
'Til you grab their heart and shove a spearhead right through
Then they regret it because it wasn't the right move
Your real nigga talk seems bogus
A real nigga don't brag about being real as long as he knows it
And his future doesn't seem hopeless
A real nigga stays out of jail, handles shit, and he keeps focused
So all you rappers whose soul is out in the wrong
You inspire the issue I wrote about in this song
You go to pile on the young who roam around in the slums
See this is what happens when rap's overcrowded with bums
Hope the hour is long when I'm rolling out with your tongue
The man above is my guide
you know the power is strong
All you menacing freaks are only in it for cheese
And the mass control limit was breached - fuck hip-hop
They only in it for cheese
and any eyewitness can see
They purposely making the innocent weak
My existence on this planet's for you, I ain't only here to benefit me
Yo, we need to make a change while there's still time
It is hard, and sometimes I struggle trying to reveal mine
I can guide you if you feel blind
I just need you to be willing to journey into my ill mind

Jefe
Du-Rag

These niggas say they heard of me, I ain't heard of you
Get the fuck up out my fuckin' face, 'fore I murder you
Bitch niggas always jackin' blood, but I know they fu
Whole squad full of fuckin' killers, I'm a killer too
Sending shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, nigga
Everybody gettin' pop, pop, popped, nigga
The thing go rrrah, rrrah, rrrah, rrrah, rrrah, nigga
We send shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, nigga

I was stuck in the ghetto where the guns kept poppin'
I wasn't gang-bangin', I was trappin' non-stoppin'
Me being broke and bumming was not an option
Someone could least collect, cocaine coppin'
Turned into rock when I started with a weapon
When I mixed it with a baggie so
I watched them ditch it for triple
Had them junkies vocal like a cripple like they all cripple
'Cause he kept on size like a small midget
More beef than the butcher 'round him
But he my blood 'til the day I die him, I can't
Told me holy my chin when I was facin' five to ten
He gave me six, I did four of 'em
Forever I'm a criminal, the popo, fuck 'em
They just wanna lock a nigga, throw away the key
Throw some numbers at your face that you really can't believe
Now your back on the cellblock, shit is looking bleak
Got your baby mama crying in the listed every week
The judge federal, twenty-five to life
All over some shit that just happened one night
All over some shit that just happened one night

I was stuck in the ghetto where the guns kept poppin'
I wasn't gang-bangin', I was trappin' non-stoppin'
Me being broke and bumming was not an option
Someone could least collect, cocaine coppin'
Stuck in the ghetto where the guns kept poppin'
I wasn't gang-bangin', I was trappin' non-stoppin'
Me being broke and bumming was not an option
Someone could least collect, cocaine coppin'

She a freak ho, fuck her, she on beast mode 
Arch your back, put your hands on your knees, ho 
I'm on beast mode, shoot you through your peep-hole
Said he want smoke, I don't really see it though

I was stuck in the ghetto where the guns kept poppin'
I wasn't gang-bangin', I was trappin' non-stoppin'
Me being broke and bumming was not an option
Someone could least collect, cocaine coppin'
Stuck in the ghetto where the guns kept poppin'
I wasn't gang-bangin', I was trappin' non-stoppin'
Me being broke and bumming was not an option
Someone could least collect, cocaine coppin'

Shit, I told you bitch ass niggas I wasn't playin'!
It's Durag nigga!
Let's get it!

Author: Beastie Boys

Now here's a little story I gots to tell
about three bad brothers you know so well.
It started way back in history with Adrock, MCA and me, Mike D.

Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere.
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer.
Ridin' cross the land, kickin' up sand.
Sheriff's posses on my tail cuz I'm in demand.
One lonely Beastie I be
all by myself without nobody.
The sun is beatin' down on my baseball hat.
The air is gettin' hot, the beer is gettin' flat.
Lookin' for a girl, I ran into a guy.
His name is MCA, I said "howdy", he said "hi."

He told a little story that sounded well rehearsed.
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst.
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip.
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip.
He said "Can I get some?"
I said "You can't get none."
I had a chance to run
pulled out his shotgun.
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead.
He put the gun to my head and this is what he said:
"Now my name is MCA, I got a license to kill.
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill.
So what do we have here?
An outlaw and his beer.
I run this land, you understand, I've made myself clear."
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin.

You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin.

"Now I've got the gun, you've got the brew.
You've got two choices of what you can do.
It's not a tough decision as you can see.
I can blow you away or you can ride with me."
I said, "I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border.
The Sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter.
I did it like this, I did it like that.
I did it with the whiffle ball bat.
So I'm on the run, the cop's got my gun.
And right about now it's time to have some fun.
The King Adrock, that is my name
and I know the fly spot where they got the champagne."
We rode for six hours then we hit the spot.
The beat was-a-bumpin' and the girlies was hot.
This dude was starin' like he knows who we are
we took the empty spot next to him at the bar.
MCA said "Yippe-Yo, you know this kid?"
I said I didn't but I know he did.
The kid said, "Get ready, cuz this ain't funny.
My name is Mike D and I'm bout to get money."
Pulled out the jammey, aimed it at the sky.
He yelled, "Stick 'em up!" And let two fly.
Hands went up and people hit the floor.
He wasted two kids that ran for the door.
"I'm Mike D and I get respect.
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect."
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
so I grabbed the piano player and punched him in the face.
The piano player's out, the music stopped.
His boy had beef, and he got dropped.
Mike D grabbed the money, MCA snatched the gold.
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold.

Author: Hopsin

Yeah, Hopsin, Fuck all you, C'mon
Keep sleeping on me
Hollywood ass rappers, bitch ass females?
Huh, that's enough to make a nigga flip
I erupt like a bomb, so give up the baton
I'll slap you after bustin' a fuckin' nut in my palm
Why you muggin' me like something was wrong?
Just take a puff of the bong
And let me leave your mind corrupt from the song
See you can't stop me, cuz I'mma brainwash teens
And create false dreams cuz it pays off clean
I'm just an idiotic, ironic, symbolic, Illuminati product
That's gonna be killed if I talk about it 
This industry business is all screwed up
I have no favorite rappers because all you suck!
I sever the weakest niggas who not on my pedigree
Cuz on a tombstone is as hard as their name will ever be
I'm judged by my wild image a lot

And everybody seems to think I have a sinister plot
I do! Be offended by every sentence I jot
I got some militant thoughts, and you ain't killin' 'em off!
So listen

I sag my pants until my ass shows
I even slap hoes 
Yeah, I'm an asshole
Yeah, yeah

And your parents hate me 'cuz I love you 
Tell 'em I said "Fuck you!"
Yeah I said "Fuck You!"
Yeah, yeah

I snuck in Drake's house when he was alone inside
You can say I have a bogus mind
I dimmed the lights down and closed the blinds
Around his neck is where my rope was tied
I yanked on it 'till it broke his spine 
Lately I been fucking pissed off 
'Cuz everybody sayin' Lil Wayne spits raw
I'll start a big brawl, and slam his ass into a brick wall
And have a fat nigga sit on him, Rick Ross 
I don't play with this rap shit
I got no life, I stay in the attic
Fuck your rap career, I'm waiting to smash it
Soulja Boy you got a corny flow
So you can suck my fucking dick through a glory hole
I'm just being me, what you tryna hate for?

All you niggas is faker than Lupe Fiasco claiming he skateboards
Yeah right, that nigga can't even ollie
Push him away on the dolly, not even Satan can stop me!
What?

I sag my pants until my ass shows
I even slap hoes 
Yeah, I'm an asshole
Yeah, yeah
And your parents hate me 'cuz I love you 
Tell 'em I said "Fuck you!"
Yeah I said "Fuck You!"
Yeah, yeah

I'm probably the sickest motherfucker who don't get recognized
Eazy-E's wife's life somewhere now jeopardized
She signed me and I was set aside
For like 3 and a half years, I don't think I remember why
I'm fucking dope and this is my reward?
That's wacker than the 500 dollars you signed me for!
Eazy's dead now, yeah the label's finally yours
Too bad he never knew that you were just a grimy whore!
You can't maintain what Eric built
I know he's in his grave turning like a ferris wheel
Don't think you cool just cuz you inherit mills
Bitch bare of skills
I'm Hopsin, I spit shit so unfair and real
I got some deep, dark issues within

All because you lied and tried to pretend you a friend
Fuck Ruthless! Bitch, I'll never lend you a hand!
And I'mma make sure nobody ever sign with you again!
You know why?

I sag my pants until my ass shows
I even slap hoes 
Yeah, I'm an asshole
Yeah, yeah
And your parents hate me 'cuz I love you 
Tell 'em I said "Fuck you!"
Yeah I said "Fuck You!"
Yeah, yeah

Your Majesty,

This letter is a token of my love for you.
When I was in the university, I took Sociology 101 with Dr.
M.
P.
K.
Okyerefo.
One day as he was lecturing, he said something that really got my attention.
He remarked, "
Men marry downwards the social ladder while Women marry upwards the social ladder."

I was dumbfounded.

Why am I telling you this?
My last letter to you was intercepted and something that was meant for your sole consumption, got into public domain.
People have questioned how I'm gonna finance our wedding and visit to the 21 countries.
That day, I left the lecture hall with so much to digest.
I made a covenant with God to work extra harder in order to land the kindda woman I envisage as a wife.
I knew from that day that I needed to be a ‘king' to marry a ‘queen'.
I needed to be superfluously wealthy to do more than just touring 21 countries for honeymoon to flying my wife abroad for water birth delivery everytime she's a month away from delivery.
Wealth is made in our minds and small small we shall grow together – I know you will understand this due to your spirit of discernment and intellectual capacity.

You are the kindda woman that men shall search a lifetime but won't find: an endangered species among the 21st century.
I hope you will not have a problem with my inordinate taste for an Indian girl's waist because You will be the most wonderful woman to have ever crossed my path in my love chronicles and not marrying you wouldn't be an option.

Even if you do not feel the same at the moment, I can go through life knowing that I fell in love with the right girl.
An additional interesting observation is that you always look gorgeous anytime I see you in my trance and your pretty heart is where I wanna make my home.
At night, I will hold you close like a Spanish guitar and gaze into your eyes without a blink.
Eeerrmm, Lady, I don't know what you make of me now but all I can say is that I will love you forever.
Our children will not be in a situation to say "
Our parents are divorced, separated or whatsoever" I will learn to like what you like and despise what you despise.
I SHALL NEVER IN MY LIFE SCREAM AT YOU NOR THROW MY HAND AT YOU.
Whenever you are down, I will give you a tight hug, pat you on the back, and whisper into your ears, "
YOU ARE SAFE WITH ME AND I LOVE YOU MORE."
I can't wait to share moments when we shall laugh over merely funny stuff: Like Beyonce, I will be your clown on your favorite channel.
I also look forward to moments when we would exchange pleasantries all day: Times when a night away from home will seem like a decade in our hearts.
To be continued…

Meth lab in the back and the crack smoke peels
Through the streets like an early morning fog
Momma's in the slaughter house with a hatchet
Helping Daddy chop early morning hog
I'm catching Zs like an early morning saw
When I woke up to the racket yawn and pause
What the fuck man I can never get sleep man
Peeped out the window what's wrong with ya'll

Stood up in my Crimson Tide Alabama sweatpants and threw my pillow
Looks like Daddy caught the motherfucker
That tried to sneak in and steal his elbows
They don't know that old man don't hold hands or throw hands

Naw, he's rough like a brillo

Went to the Chevy and pulled out a machete
And a gun as heavy and tall as the midget Willow
Think he's playin'

You better listen what he's sayin' punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you

He got an old Mossberg
In the mossy oak duffle bag laying in the back of the donk boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you Think he's playin'

You better listen what he's sayin' punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
He got an old Mossberg
In the mossy oak duffle bag laying in the back of the donk boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
11: 30 and I'm pulling up dirty
Smoking babbage out the back of my buddy's Monte Carlo

Spitting over some Supa Hot Beats
With a super hot freak we call the parking lot ho
You know we sipping on that old brown bottle
Bass in the trunk make the whole town wobble

So when we ride around bitches follow
But tonight one of the bitches is giving us problems
Well one of them bitches be fucking one of my homeboy's favorite bitches
And he's been on his hit list for a minute
And I think he's ready to handle his business
He told me "Yelawolf, get this"
And he handed me the Cartier watch that was on his wrist
He said "Watch this shit"
And he jumped to the trunk and grabbed his biscuit, biscuit
Think he's playin'
You better listen what he's sayin' punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
He got an old Mossberg
In the mossy oak duffle bag laying in the back of the donk boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you Think he's playin'
You better listen what he's sayin' punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
He got an old Mossberg
In the mossy oak duffle bag laying in the back of the donk boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
Two men stand, one's gotta go
One falls down to the ground, one walks down to the road
Momma better call the police
Now he's screaming no
Took a buckshot to the chest with a rock salt shell and he's moving slow
All this blood has spilled, enough to give a penguin chills
Hot enough to make a potato smoke at the tip of the hollowed steel
In the valley of the hollowed field
In the valley of the hollowed tip
This ain't a figment of my imagination buddy
This is where I live - Bama
Think he's playin'
You better listen what he's sayin' punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
He got an old Mossberg
In the mossy oak duffle bag laying in the back of the donk boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you Think he's playin'
You better listen what he's sayin' punk
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you
He got an old Mossberg
In the mossy oak duffle bag laying in the back of the donk boy
Don't make me go pop the trunk on you

Baby shape, figure 8 like Picasso draw ya

Oh yes I'm winnin', bling kingin', ring blingin'

Don't get choked smoking OG Oakland
Shout out Oakland

Aye, baby just pass me the hoo-kah cause

I think we got kicked out because we're a group of black people and like, I guess people... what's going on in America, they're afraid we're gonna say something or do something, but we just wanted to watch the rally, and to get kicked out because we're a group of black people is really crazy. It shows you how racist our own school is that we can't even go to our own school conference

Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

I like white folks, but I don't like you
All the niggas in the hood wanna fight you
Surprised El Chapo ain't tried to snipe you
Surprised the Nation of Islam ain't tried to find you
Have a rally out in L.A., we gon fuck it up
Home of the Rodney King riot, we don't give a fuck
Black students, ejected from your rally, what?
I'm ready to go right now, your racist ass did too much
I'm bout to turn Black Panther
Don't let Donald Trump win, that nigga cancer
He too rich, he ain't got the answers
He can't make decisions for this country, he gon crash us
No, we can't be a slave for him
He got me appreciating Obama way more
Hey Donald, and everyone that follows
You gave us your reason to be President, but we hate yours

Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
I don't like your ass, nigga
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
I really don't like you, nigga!
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
This for my grandma!
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

Nigga am I tripping? Let me know
I thought all that Donald Trump bullshit was a joke
Know what they say when rich niggas go broke
Look, Reagan sold coke, Obama sold hope
Donald Trump spent his trust fund money on the vote
I'm from a place where you prolly can't go
Speaking for some people that you prolly ain't know
It's pressure built up and it's prolly gong blow
And if we say go then they're prolly gong go
You vote Trump then you're prolly on dope
And if you like me then you prolly ain't know
And if you been to jail you can prolly still vote
We let this nigga win, we gong prolly feel broke
You built walls? We gong prolly dig holes
And if your ass do win, you gong prolly get smoked
Fuck nigga, fuck you!

I will build a great, great wall on our southern border
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words

Hold up, I fuck with Mexicans, got a plug with Mexicans
Want a little, need a switch, who I call? A Mexican
This Comedy Central ass nigga couldn't be the President
Hold up, Nip, tell the world how you fuck with Mexicans
It wouldn't be the USA without Mexicans
And if it's time to team up, shit, let's begin
Black love, brown pride in the sets again
White people feel the same as my next to kin
If we let this nigga win, God bless the kids
God bless the kids, this nigga wicked and wigged
When me and Nip link, that's Bloods and Crips
Where your L.A. rally? We gon crash your shit

Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump, yeah

Thugga
Aye

Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?

Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah

Rollie pollie ollie, nigga

No gold card, I use a trojan, nigga

Drinking red, raviolis, nigga
Fucked her in store 'til they was closing, nigga
Head and pussy feed my motion, nigga

I found her phone and I didn't scroll through, nigga
Green slime ball, bases loaded nigga

I think they jumped on my pockets cause they swollen, nigga
Drophead, it's a drophead
Haiti boy, I leave them shot dead
You ain't no gangsta nigga, stop that
I fucked that bitch before she gave me head
Telling me you're gon' win
That's some shit I don't know about
Fucked her in the deep end
That's some shit you gon' know about
Big B, Willy B, still smoking gas, eyes low as a Chinese
Still wearing flags, bitch I bleed 'til I'm deceased
I ain't talking guns, but I smoke the head of Khalif'
Call Thot-Keesha, she got the head of the week
This so bien, mamacita no Weezy
Nigga tatted her with nut and she ain't sleeveless
She want every drop that come out a penis

I need a freak
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah

First to pull up, I'm a, gangsta I know

He know, she know, we know, take that, Debo
Leave a fuck boy leaking bout a kilo
I will, pull up, S-L-I-M-E, my steelo

He see me kickin' shit now he wanna sell me that moto
Plus he know I got stripes like Ocho Cinco
Yeah he know a nigga Lion-hearted, no bingo
The world could thing I'm dreaming but I swear to God he know
What your momma tell you about playing with that fire?
Didn't God tell you if you livin' you gon' die?
When you shot 'em up you know that pressure was applied
My nephew saw his daddy get sent out home to the sky
If you knew any better he would've said 'don't break rules'
If I didn't know better I would've stayed in a school
If that bitch didn't know better I would've of played it in two
If I didn't know better I would've crossed out God and went voodoo

I need a freak
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga

I'm in the street, why?
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
Ah
I need a freak
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
Yeah I'm a motherfucking beast, nigga
I'm in the street, why?
Cause I'm a motherfucking beast
I'm a moth

Mamacita, cita, cita
Mamacita, cita, cita

This the last days to the rodeo, last night
Had me down in the back, comatose, don't think
Sun shades and a pill gon' help
Once I'm gone, can't tame myself
Mamacita, cita, cita
You know I really need yah, need yah, need yah, right now
She get freaky when the... light's down
The shit's crack, no way niggas could pipe down
With the head first, got her straight out of the night gown
Nothin' like the light-skinned mamacitas in H-Town
They got them pornstar big booties
Let me film it, then shoot it
3-D money, no illusion
Depending if I'm feelin' bougie
Might hit your line bitch

Cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her
And I ain't kin to Wayne but that's my mamacita
Mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita 
That's my mama, mamacita, that's my mama, mamacita

2: Young Mothafuck a girl
I love her, I'mma give her the world
Aye fuck her, I wanna fuck her mother
Just might give her my little girl
No, I won't let go, row that boat
She look the best with her fro
Natural nat-nat on go
Damn, Quan, turn on the stove
Whip it 'til I have a stroke
I do not fuck with America
I get it straight off the boat
Oh damn, the kush it never make me choke
Slow down, I'm speedin' and I got a trunk full of wham
Damn, 25 thousand on an old school Cam
Incest me, the bitches wanna molest me
Damn they'll sex me, she a lesbi
She want chicken like sesame
And she tryin' to undress me, test me
Give her hotel keys like Cassidy, ya dig?

Cut my phone off, bitch got it vibratin' on me like a beeper
Boy I'm in Colorado, smokin' California reefer
Hey, the bitch so bad, caught a ticket cause I really wanna meet her

454, I pull up on niggas, I tell 'em lets get it

Benjamin Franklin, niggas know that I keep it 100
Got me a new clip for my .223 and that bitch hold a hundred 
I'm still in the hood, I got me a check and I don't want no Nike's
Bitches, they suckin', and fuckin', they do everything except bite it
I can go slow like an old man, I can go fast like I got nitrous
Spent 20 racks for my brother's appeal and I ain't talkin' no Vicodin
Over 1 mil in this room, bitch, I kinda sound like a Pisces
Lil' bitch you know I'm the bomb and 2 Chainz the light, no lightnin'
Wow, these bitches excited, me and Thugger, we 'bout to start up a riot
I ain't got no pussy all week, I'm on that "bitch, suck my dick" diet

Monica, come home to me, yea come home to me my dear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Teresea, I'm tired of lookin' bae, I'm into you, your rear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser

Ain't nothin' special man, I sold it all yester'
Pull in Phipps Plaza in a motherfuckin' Tesla
Ain't no pressure when you got a little extra
Put them beams on your face, have 'em lookin' like freckles
Dammit man, I do not know Tar but I'm having Xan's
My bitch pussy wet like it's wetting rain
This bitch clap on me while I clap at mans, woah
Got Balenciaga's I ain't even wore yet
Half a pound of gas I ain't smoke yet
Traphouse filled up with Ziploc
Used to give my living room super big lots
In a strip club with some flip-flops
Thought it's the time, baby it's not
Got a lotta windows on my crib, nigga
Bout to put that motherfucker in a tint shop

"Who killed little boy, who killed little boy?
Rat infested hallways, no escape, no escape
From misery, no way out from that hell"

I'm bout to give these niggas what they asked for
I used to have to argue with my land lord
Yea, my nickname is Titty Boi
Bitch gotta have at least a handful
All my cribs came with a damn pool
Used to stash work in my camel
Young 6'5" with the handle
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom 
Front grill looking like it's dancin' 
Put some stacks on your head little boy 
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson 
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon 
Put rifle bullets in a handgun 
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga 
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on
All my cars I done put rims on 'em
I done touched down, no end zone
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga
On the right bet that bitch got a Sprint phone 
Man she got about 100 acres
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on
And I just pop me a perc
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on

You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you're loyal

Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing
You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing…
Will never come between, our thing
And we ain't mean for it to be this serious…
I made a promise to you and I'ma take it serious
Cause I know my words mean the most to you
And you mean the most to me
We got a special relation, can't nobody come between

We made a bond from the very beginning
I found my homey and my best friend
Imma be there for ya till the very end,
No matter what, no matter what, no matter what, yeah
We broke the rules, we took it further in
I made a promise to you ima take it serious cause i know my words mean the most to you
and you mean the most to you

My bitches be running, they chasing that paper
I'll serve you like waiters, I'm high like a scraper
Put a hole in your head, you look like a pacer
I'm sliming, I'm coming, know why I look at you funny?
My bitches chase money I'm cashing out for 100 P's
Put em straight in the trap and then it collect the green
Your bitches want to caress the young slime king
Your old man want to arrest me for some slime things
I'm a fucking king cobra
Thugger, Thugger, not snitching, but I told ya
Catch a trip, now they hit him with that mini chopper
I'm not talking Africans but they say blocka blocka
I can't stop
I got young niggas standing on the block
I told him chill but he refused to stop selling rocks
He told me I never need license, he go shoot at cops
Put em down, Thugga run round with 100 some rounds
Serving in everyone's town
These niggas ain't got no money to dress like I dress
These niggas don't show out and be oh so fresh
Got red bottoms for me and my chick
My camera man got red bottoms on cause I'm so rich
My bus driver wearing Louis cause I'm Gucci bitch
My chef got on Ferragamos, nigga cook that shit
I got that stupid bread, my mama don't got to want for shit
I bought a hard top Lamb, didn't even want the shit
1017 brick squad, bitch I own that shit
A nigga disrespect me, I can't condone that shit
I got a 10 O clock appointment at the office, trick
They pour a half a pint of lean in that coffee bitch

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Yeah...

Shot gun, aimed at my heart, you got one

How do we call this love

It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone

A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Maybe some part of you just hates me
You pick me up and play me
How do we call this love? 
One time tell me you need me tonight
To make it easy, you lie
And say it's all for love 

It seems like we've been losing control
Somebody tell me I'm not alone
When I say

All I need's a little love in my life
All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart

Whoa oh, whoa oh
Me and my broken heart
Whoa oh, whoa oh

How do we call this?

All I need's a little love in the dark
A little but I'm hoping it might kick start
Me and my broken heart
I need a little loving tonight
Hold me so I'm not falling apart

Swear to God, you my bread & butter
You can get my all if the Feds destroy us

I ain't gotta tell these hoes, they know I'm prince of the city
I just might pull up with bad bitches and take em to the
trenches
Rosé goin right inside the kitchen
I might be a lame if I don't pay that ho tuition
I find out like two weeks ago that I was pimp
I don't stack that shit by the four 'cause I'm not a shrimp
Man I do it, put that shit on everything she know I do it
Fuck that work I might not do it 
Like my daddy or the school, I might listen to it
Flaws and all, fell in with my dawgs
Flaws and all, even with my paw
Versace drawers for your broad
Flaws and all

She say she down and she gon lay and care for me

Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins, body red like an apple
Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my money
Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others
I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper

Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we goin wrestle

Hop it up and ride with my baby

Buyin' Rollies on Rollies like I'm Flavor Flavor's shrimp
Versace cover, roll that bitch up like some weed
She want that  like an

We go shoppin' in Bahamas for the beach
Take off in car but I need orders for me
And I'ma beat that pussy, concrete
Like a mothafuckin' street
I'ma feed her my milk
Every time I feel tired, I need three hoes like a help
You're a ho, ho, ho, don't care I'ma keep it all to myself
Tie my ties on your belt

I heard someone's  walked in and said

Okay lil mama sharp with a razor

And like Wayne, baby it's all at the start
Girl I'm just startin' with that pussy

Stop talkin', pussy nigga, you a wussy

Sprayin' my cologne now we smell just like some cookies

Got a room full of big booty bitches, it's my prime

Me and her had never made love 'til I fucked her
Lil' lil' mama never fell for it 'til I bust her
And you a pretty, pretty girl, no cover
Fuck you with no rubber
Since your family don't like me I'll let shots go at your brother
And your body look like gold when we fuck in Versace covers
Just because that pussy good, that don't mean that I'ma trust you
That crazy bitch stalkin' my brother Thugger

She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like "yeah, yeah," I was like "no, no"
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse

And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth

So I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love
I never made love, never made love


I never made love, never made love


I never made love, never made love
When she open up, I'ma taste her
X out everyone and then erase her
I'm sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles
Be all on her mind, she can't even think of
She walkin' off, I look at her like cable
Boolin' with your partners at a party
They don't even know what the fuck love means
She say she never waste time on me
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby
I heard it, even though I suck it 'til she lockin' up
Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day
Girl how come we never made love at your spot?

Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out
She want it so I spent 12 thousand on a lil' rug
I'm just tryna tell you, ain't tryna make you look low

Even though you've never made love, never made love

She never made love, never made love


She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never felt love, never felt love


Well I'ma change that there
I just might wake up and buy you everything rare
I'm not cheatin' on you no more, I don't care
You wanna be with me, I'ma roll the dice now
Roll it, I buy a Rollie, I'ma buy that bitch a Rollie
That pack keep rollin', I'ma buy that bitch some more shit
Cause I fucked her sister then I fucked on all her cousins
Bitch I'm a Blood, you know I fucked on your bousins
She smiling in your face, but tellin' me she love it
She like the way my pants don't sag even though they're stuffy
She won't T.I. on me, she don't care 'bout no money
Hey hey, wait, don't leave

They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folger's
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, "don't ever do that shit there again"
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid?
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I try to get back and get some head

And I know that's wrong but my dumb ass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one
Then I told her don't ever do it again
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah

Then I realized I'd never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love
She never ever ever made love

Shorty so fine that I can't put the bitch out

1017 boss, bitch call me gold mouth
Big Guwop in the house and he showed out
Disrespect Brick Squad, and you get drugged out
Every time I look down the street, that's a plug walk
Gucci used to be the shiznit, can he still lift?

Telling everybody in the place, can't sit still
Sorry to say that I know where your bitch live
Gucci used to be a rich man, and he still is
Bag came wrong, Imma show them what the deal is
Rolling like motherfucker, 45 X pills
She make me say   easy

Woah, woah, woah

15 hundred climbing out a nigga's nose
Spend 30 thousand dollars on her clothes

Brand new Bentley, Young Thug in it
Her hair extended, my clip extended
Me and her twinses, Ferragamo and Fendi
Jimmy call for the Lindsay's, mouth gold, no pennies
Got to keep up my image, so therefore I got birds flying
Birds over your head, no pretending, I got plenty
Freeze, bitch get in position
Knees, please, suck me till I'm empty

I sit alone in my four-cornered room staring at candles
Oh that shit is on? Heh
Let me drop some shit like this here Real smooth

At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candle sticks in the dark, visions of bodies being burned
Four walls just staring at a nigga
I'm paranoid, sleeping with my finger on the trigga
My momma's always stressing I ain't living right
But I ain't going out without a fight
See, everytime my eyes close
I start sweatin', and blood starts comin' out my nose
It's somebody watchin' the Ak'
But I don't know who it is, so I'm watchin my back
I can see him when I'm deep in the covers
When I awake I don't see the motherfucker
He owns a black hat like I own
A black suit and a cane like my own
Some might say "Take a chill, B"
But fuck that shit, there's a nigga trying to kill me
I'm poppin' in a clip when the wind blows
Every twenty seconds got me peepin' out my window
Investigatin' the joint for traps
Checkin' my telephone for taps
I'm starin' at the woman on the corner
It's fucked up when your mind is playin' tricks on ya

I make big money, I drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
But late at night, somethin ain't right
I feel I'm being tailed by the same sucker's head lights
Is it that fool that I ran off the block
Or is it that nigga last week that I shot
Or is it the one I beat for five thousand dollars
Thought he had 'caine but it was Gold Medal Flour
Reach under my seat, grabbed my popper for the suckers
Ain't no use to be lying, I was scareder than a motherfucker
ed a left into Popeye's and beared down quick
If it's going down let's get this shit over with
Here they come, just like I figured
I got my hand on the motherfucking trigger
What I saw'll make your ass start giggling
Three blind, crippled and crazy senior citizens
I live by the sword
I take my boys everywhere I go, because I'm paranoid
I keep looking over my shoulder and peeping around corners
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Day by day it's more impossible to cope
I feel like I'm the one that's doin' dope
Can't keep a steady hand because I'm nervous
Every Sunday mornin' I'm in service
Praying for forgiveness
And trying to find an exit out of the business
I know the Lord is looking at me
But yet and still it's hard for me to feel happy
I often drift when I drive
Havin fatal thoughts of suicide
BANG and get it over with
And then I'm worry-free, but that's bullshit
I got a little boy to look after
And if I died then my child would be a bastard
I had a woman down with me
But to me it seemed like she was down to get me
She helped me out in this shit
But to me she was just another bitch
Now she's back with her mother
Now I'm realizing that I love her
Now I'm feeling lonely

My mind is playin' tricks on me

This year Halloween fell on a weekend
Me and Geto Boyz are trick-or-treating
Robbing little kids for bags
Till a law man got behind our ass
So we speeded up the pace
Took a look back and he was right before our face
He'd be in for a squable no doubt
So I swung and hit the nigga in his mouth
He was going down, we figga'd
But this wasn't no ordinary nigga
He stood about six or seven feet
Now, that's the nigga I'd been seeing in my sleep
So we triple-teamed on him
Dropping them motherfuckin' beads on him
The more I swung the more blood flew
Then he disappeared and my boys disappeared, too
Then I felt just like a fiend
It wasn't even close to Halloween
It was dark as fuck on the streets
My hands were all bloody from punching on the concrete
God damn, homie
My mind is playin' tricks on me

Author: Joyner Lucas feat. Logic

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD
Is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors

One time for them prayin' on my downfall 
Two times for the homies in the chow hall 
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad 
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back 
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— 

Kidnap a nigga like ISIS 
Turn a whole world to a crisis 
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this 
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh 
Beat the police with a nightstick 
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk 

Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out 
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house 
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch 
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out 
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow 
Errybody dissin' just to have clout 
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? 

Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin', I been livin' in the dungeon 
I done held a couple grudges went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil I'm his cousin, I ain't settlin' for nothin' 
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' 
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' 
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven 

But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? 
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties 
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine 
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time 
We do not share the same bloodline 
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time 

According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious

One time for them prayin' on my downfall 
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore 
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad 
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back 
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— 

Me and Joyner need a couple hearses 
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat, kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit that never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, and you blast

Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision

Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS 
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit 
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post 
I just had a steak back at Mastro's, my god

Me and Joyner need a couple hearses 
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And five-nine was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we still the gang-dum
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!

One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!

ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS

I remember I wanted for to quit for so many times
But I know this moment'd come, now it's my time
I gotta make up for all them nights that my Momma cried
I'm goin' in, I'm putting everything on the line
Dropped out of school to chase my dream, I had some for to prove
I put my all in this shit, man I can't fuckin' lose
They smile up in my face but they don't know what I been through
Whole lotta nights I went to sleep and I ain't had no food
But now I'm up and I'm just thinking about my next move
Gotta keep my head above water, gotta make it through
I do this shit for my momma and my lil' brother too
Ain't no more problems now I might as well go back to school
Gotta maintain, stay on my grind no I can't be no fool
Naw I can't slip nor I can't fumble, gotta stick and move
Get out BR, move to LA, where I ain't gotta keep a tool
Surprise but I knew my dreams coming true


We ain't have nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
We here next day, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
 

Now that I made it, ain't none the same it all changed
When I'm in public people see me they screaming my name
Just a few days ago I was locked up in them chains
Now I'm in back of the Maybach with a lot of bands
I ain't worry 'bout 'em dissin' naw, I don't hear a thing they sayin'
This for sons in Montana and can't forget 
I never jeopardize this and lose it all again
This for that North, 38 baby, they know I ain't playing
From the heart I appreciate all of my fans
This for Monique for loving me and bein' my helping hand
I really did it, this for for mom's, Three, Trey and Aaron
Can't nobody tell me nothing I'm like what you sayin'


We ain't have nothing, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga
Never change on my gang yeah, I'm stuck with my niggas
We untouchable come run that money up with me nigga
We here next day, stayed down 'til I came up with my niggas
Right or wrong forever right, you know wassup with me nigga

She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae

Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey

I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me: "Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!"
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy

I got a lotta cash
I don't mind spending it

Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrappin 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya

R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate
Your main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape
Rich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga 
Broke niggas, I can never get along with them
Always been hated since a little nigga 
It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it

Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some "tings", one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got xan's in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we have the club going up

Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
Ain't got fuckin' time to party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly pink
I got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn 'bout what she think

Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

And I know I know how I made it on my own
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta' go, you're moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey

People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol {c'mon!}
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
{Just let it goooooo!}


Hand me an, 8, beam me up and land me in space
I'ma sit on top of the world {I'm here} and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill {Ahh!}
Human horror film
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not {yup}
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
and a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?


{Just pull the plug!}
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin to it

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments {Ow! Ow! Ow!}
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it {c'mon}
I laugh at the sight of death
as I fall down a cement flight of steps {ahhhhhhhh!}
and land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out

Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!


{Just let it gooo!}
People say that I'm a bad influence

My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
and place the clip and cock it back
and let it go until your brains are rippin out
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!

Author: Skepta feat. WizKid

Greaze
True

Ay
I'm tryna get paid, take money, cash cheques
You see the set that's Lash, that's Dex
Young C, Young Shorty, Milkavelli
White bricks, True Religion on the telly
Its me
Wiz got the house full of freaks
That's why I haven't been around for a week
I'm getting pounds in my sleep
I'm at the top of the mountain, it's peak
Bring it back before the villain
I had a life, real talk, True Religion
It's in the blood, in the genes, in the stitching
Walked in, no weapon made a killing
Tongue kissing pretty women
New iPhone 'cause I'm done with all the bitchin'
Tryna be in my position
Keep my shades on 'cause they tryna see the vision

She tell me, badman, see, I need your love
See, I need your love 
Mi need you close to me, me, tell her say, me, no stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make it stay far away
Just give me love for the night
Give me love for the night girl, waste no time

Breakfast in bed on a plane
I could never complain
I was walking with the limp, had the cane
Dex said greatness and nothing was the same
Now we're set for life
I saw the turn up button and I pressed it twice
You heard I'm in the club, then my best advice
Is put you shoes on and come and get your wife
'Cause we've been having sex just for exercise
Every night, man a doing sexercise
She looks into my eyes now she's mesmerised

She tell me, badman, see, I need your love
See, I need your love
Mi need you close to me, me, tell her say, me, no stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make it stay far away
Just give me love for the night
Give me love for the night girl, waste no time

Ay, they better get used to the flex
African man, you see the jewels on my neck
Black James Bond, that's the new silhouette
You see me in the street and I was moving correct
Been running around, tryna do the home run
Left that girl she was no fun
I tie one, smoke one
Big chief Skeppy and I answer to no one
Counting my blessings, I'm feeling special
Birds eye view, SK level
Give them the Shaku when I dance with the devil
Young Fela Kuti the return of the rebel
I told her I need some space
Real busy body never stay in one place
And she knows I've got more tricks under my sleeve
That's why she never wants me to leave

She tell me, badman, see, I need your love
See, I need your love
Mi need you close to me, me, tell her say, me, no stay on the road
Bad energy stay far away, make you stay far away
Just give me love for the night
Give me love for the night girl, waste no time

I don't know why I'm speakin'
You say, you say, you say
It's way too late, goodbye, you leavin'

Meditate me, get me piece of mind
It's only she and I, ocean floor, how deep we dive
We be high lookin' for another fuckin' tree to climb
She was playin' hard to get, I read between her lines
Binge watched "Sopranos", made it all the way to season five
I am her, she is I
She had to come, see her freaky side, leavin' me behind

I don't wanna be polite no more
Make yourself at home, where the fuck you gon' go?
Yeah, girl, the way you walkin' to the room, oh oh oh

Club goin' up, on a Tuesday
Got your girl in the cut and she choosey
[Verse 1 -
Squad goin' up, nobody flippin' packs now
I just did 3 in a row, them shows is back-to-back to back now
Put the world on our sound, you know PARTY and The Weeknd
Ain't got no motherfuckin' time to party on the weekend
Tell Gelo, "Bring the juice, we about to get lit"
Fill the room up with some tings, one night off and this is it
Always workin' OT, overtime and outta town
Shit is crazy back home, it kills me that I'm not around
I think we gettin' too deep; shit I'm talkin' might be too true
Upstairs I got xan's in an Advil bottle, I don't take them shits
But you do, so I got 'em for you
I don't need the pills, I'm just gon' have another drink
And when I'm puttin' work in on a weekend
I'll look back on this and think how we had the club going up

[Verse 2 -
Workin' Monday night, on the corner flippin' hard
Made at least 3 thousand, on the boulevard
I've been workin' graveyard shifts every other weekend
Ain't got no fuckin' time to party on the weekend
I've been flippin' in the house, makin' juugs on the highway
I've been ridin' out of state, makin' money like my way
I don't think that I should dance, I'm just gon' have another drink
I'm doin' my stance, you know my molly pant
I got the loudest of the loud, you know my gas stink
My P.O. think I'm in the house, don't give a damn 'bout what she think

[Bridge -
And I know I know how I made it on my own
I made my own style, I don't think that I should stay
You know I gotta' go, you're moving too fast
Don't wanna take it slow

Yeah, they try to send for me
Envy and jealousy is everything I wish upon my enemies
All that for them, right back at them
What my mind keeps telling me
Mind keeps telling me
I hear everything, I don't ask if it's all there cause it better be
Trust me it better be, no long talking or settling
Jizzzle never won no wrestling
But he's on a big belt medal ting
Streets unruly
More life for my brother's tryna better things, cause...

Cause all my man are running to the money
We be running like ah, ah, ah, ahhh
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough, these catties they be calling off my phone
All these man dem, they applaud me on the road

I put corn in for my bro
Man dem keep on talking on a low
Man dem keep talkin on a low, but all my man are bros
And all my man, all my man are bros
My man dem will have your mandem on the ropes
I'll have man dem on your road
Man dem in a batch or on they own
With a bat or with a pole
I got man dem that will slap a man with both
Nike jacket on my back I'm looking cold
It's funny how these catties wanna know, but

All my man are running to the money
We be running like ah, ah, ah, ahhh
And all my man are running from them hoes on the roads like whoa whoa whoa, whoa
Like whoa, a month ago you didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough, these catties they be calling off my phone
All these man dem, they applaud me on the road

Free smoke, anybody want it they can get it
No joke, call up landlord, nigga that's bro
I only link with the real ones, lord knows
On fo', I love to see a fake nigga go broke
I don't run to Twitter with the things I know
I fall back just to see how it unfolds
Yeah, like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa, years ago they didn't wanna know
But now I'm seeing dough
Catties they be calling up my phone
Trying to get tickets to a show
Yeah, I got U.K. tings on the WhatsApp now
Like +44 on the code

Like whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Like whoa
A month ago you didn't wanna know, but now I'm seeing dough
These catties they be calling up my phone
All these man dem they applaud me on the road
I put corn in for my bro

I don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...

And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold

These niggas prayed on my downfall
These niggas prayed on my downfall
On all ten, bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball


Go get a thermometer for the pot, I need this shit cooked right
Lets keep this water 400 degrees Fahrenheit
You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Being broke did something to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, driving German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, remember I used to use your L's to hit the road
Hit the O and make them big boy sales?
Moo, remember when you had them green things mailed
With vacuum seals trying not to have them green things smelled?
Feds was on me, what you know about related through money
I don't know nothing, I just used to see 'em walk to the Coney
I fuck with bitches my body count go from Pershing to Cody
Any further questions, you can take that up with the lawyer
My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you everyday before school I sold a half bow
How you think I won best dressed with no support?
And had them paid lawyers coming in and out of court
Aye Dwan though, aye Theo ain't it a blessing?
We made it out Kentucky after all that happened?
After the pre-trials, after the status
After them impact statements, after the castle
Aye JR nigga, ain't it a blessing?
We made it out of Lansing after all that happened?
After Michigan State, after Hubbard
When our mans told on us, them bands they took from us
Joy road bitch, but the money long as six mile
Brick mile, knock your bitch down
Pick her up, knock her back down, pull her tracks out
Yes I slap girl, yes I slap dog, yes I slap loud
Yes I'll slap a pussy nigga if he act out
Yes I caught cases on the road with them killers
Bro kill me if I snitch, cause if you snitch I'm gon' kill you
Spent a lot of time on that yard with them gorillas
Stood tall, did I let niggas hoe me? Quit being silly
I know for a fact your bitch pussy get wet for a nigga
Cause I do it better, plus I'm doing better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gone drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, "Get ahead of them niggas"
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas
You killed his mans? Then make sure you get the rest of them niggas
Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga"
So let me know what you can handle, okay come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancing, eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge
My first offer was 30 years, not a day lower
I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fucking shoulders 
You hear me? Hit the Rollie store with the Rollie on
What was our getaway car? A Jag Portfolio
You hear me? aye I heard I had some sneak dissers
Whoever feeling hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga
I don't know you niggas, fuck wrong with niggas?
Through these white buffs I can see the hoe in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoeing niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy I can't trust you with that strap if you don't got no bodies
Boy I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was coming home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cumming on
Get em to the crib, bust em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shaking like there's something wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch I came home to my lil brother gone
Niggas say they looking for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white, that paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fucking, put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds trying to build a case, I can't move wrong
I went to trial back to back, bitch I'm two and oh
The state of Kentucky banned me from every jewelry store
Say I can't even be in public with my hoodie on
Michigan State don't want him here, they don't know what he on

I know they prayed on my downfall
I know they prayed on my downfall
On all ten bitch I stood tall
Show these disloyal niggas how to ball

Author: Macklemore & Ryan Lewis

I was seven years old, when I got my first pair
And I stepped outside
And I was like, "Momma, this air bubble right here, it's gonna make me fly"
I hit back-court and when I jumped, I jumped, I swear I got so high
I touched the net, "Mom, I touched the net," this is the best day of my life

Air Max's were next,
That air bubble, that mesh

The box, the smell, the stuffin', the tread,

At school
I was so cool

I knew that I couldn't crease 'em

My friends couldn't afford 'em

Four stripes on their Adidas

On the court I wasn't the best, but my kicks were like the pros
Yo, I stick out my tongue so everyone could see that logo
Nike Air Flight, but that was so dope

And then my friend Carlos' brother got murdered for his Fours, whoa
See he just wanted a jump shot, but they wanted his Starter coat, though

Didn't wanna get caught, from Genesee Park to Othello
You could clown for those Pro Wings, with the Velcro

Those were not tight
I was trying to fly without leaving the ground,

Cause I wanted to be like Mike, right

Wanted to be him,

I wanted to be that guy, I wanted to touch the rim

I wanted to be cool, and I wanted to fit in,
I wanted what he had, America, it begins

I want to fly

Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes

And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
I stitch my wings
And pull the strings

I bought these dreams
That all fall down
We want what we can't have, commodity makes us want it

So expensive, damn, I just got to flaunt it
Got to show 'em, so exclusive, this that new shit
A hundred dollars for a pair of shoes I would never hoop in
Look at me, look at me, I'm a cool kid
I'm an individual, yeah, but I'm part of a movement
My movement told me be a consumer and I consumed it
They told me to just do it, I listened to what that swoosh said
Look at what that swoosh did
See it consumed my thoughts
Are you stupid, don't crease 'em, just leave 'em in that box
Strangled by these laces, laces I can barely talk
That's my air bubble and I'm lost if it pops
We are what we wear, we wear what we are
But see I look inside the mirror and think Phil Knight tricked us all

Will I stand for change or stay in my box
These Nikes help me define me, but I'm trying to take mine off
I want to fly
Can you take me far away?
Give me a star to reach for
Tell me what it takes
And I'll go so high
I'll go so high
My feet won't touch the ground
I stitch my wings
And pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down
It started out with what I wear to school
That first day, like these are what make you cool
And this pair, this would be my parachute
So much more than just a pair of shoes
Nah, this is what I am
What I wore, this is the source of my youth
This dream that they sold to you
For a hundred dollars and some change
Consumption is in the veins
And now I see it's just another pair of shoes

Author: LL Cool J

C'mon man

And with the local DDC news, LL Cool J with a triumphant comeback
But tonight...

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years
I'm rockin' my peers, puttin' suckers in fear
Makin' the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowerin'
Over the competition, I'm towerin'
Wrecking shop, when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare
You better move, don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's payin' the price

I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 

Don't you call this a regular jam
I'm gonna rock this land
I'm gonna take this itty-bitty world by storm
And I'm just getting warm
Just like Muhammad Ali, they called him Cassius
Watch me bash this beat like a skull
Don'tcha know I had beef wit'
Why do you riff with me, a maniac psycho
And when I pull out my jammy, get ready 'cause it might go
Blauh! How ya like me now?
The ripper will not allow
You to get wit' Mr. Smith don't riff
Listen to my gear shift
I'm blastin', outlastin'
Kinda like shaft, so you could say I'm shaftin'
Olde English filled my mind
And I came up with a funky rhyme

I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 

Breakdown

Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie

Shadow boxin' when I heard you on the radio
Uuh, I just don't know
What made you forget that I was raw?
But now I gotta new tour
I'm going insane startin' a hurricane, releasin' pain
Lettin' you know, you can't gain or maintain
Unless you say my name
Rippin', killin', diggin' and drillin' a hole
Pass the Ol' Gold

I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 

Shotgun blasts are heard
When I rip and kill, at will
The man of the hour, tower of power, I'll devour
I'm gonna tie you up and let you understand
That I'm not your average man
When I gotta jammy in my hand
Damn, ooh
Listen to the way I slay, your crew
Damage , damage , damage , damage
Destruction, terror and mayhem
Pass me a sissy, so suckas I'll slay him
Farmers , farmers 
I'm ready! 
I think I'm gonna bomb a town 
Don't you never, ever, pull my lever
'Cause I explode
And my nine is easy to load
I gotta thank God
'Cause he gave me the strength to rock, hard
Knock you out, mama said knock you out 

I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out 
I'm gonna knock you out 
Mama said knock you out

Author: Digital Underground

All right, stop whatcha doin'
'cause I'm about to ruin
the image and the style that ya used to.
I look funny,
but yo I'm makin' money, see
so yo world I hope you're ready for me.
Now gather round
I'm the new fool in town
and my sound's laid down by the Underground.
I drink up all the Hennessey ya got on ya shelf
so just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a Umpty.
Yo ladies, oh how I like to funk thee.
And all the rappers in the top ten-please allow me to bump thee.
I'm steppin' tall, y'all,
and just like Humpty Dumpty
you're gonna fall when the stereos pump me.
I like to rhyme, I like my beats funky,
I'm spunky. I like my oatmeal lumpy.
I'm sick wit dis, straight gangsta mack
but sometimes I get ridiculous
I'll eat up all your crackers and your licorice
hey yo fat girl, c'mere-are ya ticklish?
Yeah, I called ya fat.
Look at me, I'm skinny
It never stopped me from gettin' busy
I'm a freak
I like the girls with the boom
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
I'm crazy.
Allow me to amaze thee.
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me.
I'm still gettin' in the girls' pants
and I even got my own dance

The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump,
come on and do the Humpty Hump
Do the Humpty Hump, just watch me do the Humpty Hump
Do ya know what I'm doin', doin' the Humpty Hump

Do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump

People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'"
that's all right 'cause I get things cookin'
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
but ya can't get near me
I give 'em more, see, and on the floor, B,
all the girls they adore me
Oh yes, ladies, I'm really bein' sincere
'cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear.
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still gettin' paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge,
both how I'm livin' and my nose is large
I get stoopid, I shoot an arrow like Cupid,
I use a word that don't mean nothin', like looptid
I sang on Doowhutchalike, and if ya missed it,
I'm the one who said just grab 'em in the biscuits
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write.

All ya had to do was give Humpty a chance
and now I'm gonna do my dance.

Oh, yeah, that's the break, y'all
Let me hear a little bit of that bass groove right here

Now that I told ya a little bit about myself
let me tell ya a little bit about this dance
It's real easy to do--check it out

First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shakin' and twitchin' kinda like I was smokin'
Crazy wack funky
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
That's all right 'cause my body's in motion
It's supposed to look like a fit or a convulsion
Anyone can play this game
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
No two people will do it the same
Ya got it down when ya appear to be in pain

Humpin', funkin', jumpin',
jig around, shakin' ya rump,
and when the dude a chump pump points a finger like a stump
tell him step off, I'm doin' the Hump.

Black people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Puerto Ricans, do the Humpty Hump, just keep on doin' the hump
Samoans, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
Once again, the Underground is in the house
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world,
keep on doin' the Humpty Dance,
and to the ladies,
peace and humptiness forever

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream

I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around baby I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
Cause I knew that it just ain't right

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes, yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize, yeah, it was only just a dream

When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
Cause I was wrong

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back, down that road
Will she come back, no one knows
I realize yeah, it was only just a dream

If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything

I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back, down that road
Will she come back, no one knows
I realize yeah, it was only just a dream
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes yeah, it was only just a dream
So I travelled back, down that road
Will she come back, no one knows
I realize yeah, it was only just a dream

Yo VIP, let's kick it

Ice ice baby
Ice ice baby

Alright stop, collaborate and listen
Ice is back with my brand new invention
Something grabs a hold of me tightly
Flow like a harpoon daily and nightly
Will it ever stop yo I don't know
Turn off the lights and I'll glow

To the extreme I rock a mic like a vandal
Light up a stage and wax a chump like a candle
Dance go rush to the speaker that booms
I'm killing your brain like a poisonous mushroom

Deadly when I play a dope melody
Anything less than the best is a felony
Love it or leave it you better gangway
You better hit bull's eye the kid don't play
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it

Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby

Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla
Now that the party is jumping
With the bass kicked in and the Vegas are pumping
Quick to the point to the point no faking
I'm cooking MCs like a pound of bacon
Burning them if you ain't quick and nimble
I go crazy when I hear a cymbal

And a hi-hat with a souped up tempo
I'm on a roll and it's time to go solo
Rollin' in my 5.0
With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
The girlies on standby waving just to say hi

"Did you stop?" No, I just drove by
Kept on pursuing to the next stop
I busted a left and I'm heading to the next block
The block was dead
Yo so I continued to A1A Beachfront Avenue
Girls were hot wearing less than bikinis
Rockman lovers driving Lamborghinis
Jealous cause I'm out getting mine

Shay with a gauge and Vanilla with a nine
Ready for the chumps on the wall
The chumps acting ill because they're full of eight ball
Gunshots rang out like a bell
I grabbed my nine all I heard were shells
Falling on the concrete real fast
Jumped in my car slammed on the gas
Bumper to bumper the avenue's packed
I'm trying to get away before the jackers jack
Police on the scene you know what I mean

They passed me up confronted all the dope fiends
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it

Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla
Take heed cause I'm a lyrical poet

Miami's on the scene just in case you didn't know it
My town that created all the bass sound
Enough to shake and kick holes in the ground
Cause my style's like a chemical spill
Feasible rhymes that you can vision and feel
Conducted and formed, this is a hell of a concept
We make it hype and you want to step
With this. Shay plays on the fade
Slice like a ninja, cut like a razor blade

So fast, other DJs say "Damn!"
If my rhyme was a drug I'd sell it by the gram

Keep my composure when it's time to get loose
Magnetized by the mic while I kick my juice
If there was a problem yo I'll solve it
Check out the hook while D-Shay revolves it
Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice ice baby
Vanilla Ice
Yo man let's get out of here
Word to your mother
Ice ice baby too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold
Ice ice baby too cold too cold

Now tell me, what ya gonna do
When it ain't nowhere to run
When judgment comes for you
When judgment comes for you
Now tell me, what ya gonna do
When it ain't nowhere to hide
When judgment comes for you
'Cause it's gonna come for you

Dead souls, nigga, this for Wally
Eazy, C's Uncle Charlie
Little Boo, but God's got him
And I'm gonna miss everybody
I done rolled with blows like AIDS
Looked at him while he laid and prayed
But destiny played too deep for me to say
Lil' Layzie came to me
Told me if he should decease, "well, then please
Bury me by my Gran Gran
And when you can, come follow me."

God bless you workin' on a plan to Heaven
Follow the Lord all 24/7 days
God is who we praise
Even though the Devil's all up in my face
But He keepin' me safe and in my place
Say grace to the gates we race
Without a chance to face the judge
Then I guess my soul won’t budge
Grudge, because there’s no mercy for thugs
Ooh, what could I do?
It's all about a family and how we roll
Can I get a witness? Let it unfold
We livin' our lives to eternal our souls, hey-o-ayo
 
Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Still we lacin'

Now follow me, roll stroll
Whether it's Hell or it's Heaven
Come let's go take a visit to the people that's long gone, they rest: Wally, Eazy, Terry, Boo
And still keepin' up with they family
Exactly how many days we got lastin'?
While you laughin' we're passin' passin' away
God, rest our souls
'Cause I know I might meet you up at the crossroads
Y'all know, y'all forever got love from them Bone Thugs, baby

Lil E-Z long gone
Really wish he could come home
But when it's time to die, gotta go, bye bye
All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong
When the day comes
Better believe Bone got a shoulder you can lean on, lean on
 
Pray and we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray
Every day, every day, every day, every day
And we pray and we pray
And we pray and we pray


See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely


And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody when I'm gone
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody
And I'm gonna miss everybody when I'm gone
And I'm gonna miss everybody

Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me 
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me 
That's how we roll
Livin' in a hateful world
Sendin' me 
That's how we roll
And I asked the good Lord why
He sighed, he told me we live to die
 

What's up with that murder, y'all?
See, my little cousin was hung
Somebody really wrong, anybody wanna test us, dawg?
And Ms. Sleazy set up Eazy to fall
You know while we sinnin'
He intendin' on endin' it when it ends
He comin' again and again and again
Now tell me, what ya gonna do?

Can somebody anybody tell me why, hey
Can somebody anybody tell me why
We die, we die?
I don't wanna die


See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads
So you won't be lonely
See you at the crossroads

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my card

I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood but I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back
Stuart Little, heard these niggas some rats
Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissing 'til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house, keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar, thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playing Nintendo, I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Pantherville
Eighth grade started playin' football, then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out, nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016 and I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick, I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissing on twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'till a nigga get killed
'till a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one, Savage I ain't even hating"
So what's up with all that instagram shit?
"Savage I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin', bitch I hang around them Haitians
Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked
"Come on man, Savage you know I always play your mixtape"
Yeah nigga fuck all that, ask your bitch how my dick tastes

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm praying to my Glock and my card

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt
Chain swangin', diamonds blangin', hold up
Pistol swangin', gang bangin', hold up
Niggas actin' like groupies, they don't know us
Little do they know their bitches fuckin' on the tour bus

Young Savage, why you trappin' so hard?
Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers cards?
Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fucking soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I grew up in the streets without no heart

So much dope that it broke the scale
They say crack kills, nigga my crack sells
My brother in the kitchen and he rappin' a bale
Louis V my bag and Louis V on my belt

Don't bend, nigga don't fold
My uncle taught me how to scrape the bowl
And my auntie still smokin' blow
Came from nothin', nigga we was poor
Evection notices all on the door
Take out trash for some school clothes
I'm the one that the streets choose

Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine
Got my own money, pussy nigga I did not sign
Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired
I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down

Poppin' percocets on Rodeo Drive
Baby roll the window up and let's get high
You ain't no real nigga if you testify
I don't have to question where my niggas ride
If you gotta question, they ain't on your side
Plenty late nights I made my mama cry
Shootouts in apartments made my mama cry
Seen my niggas in a hearse, I Stevie Wonder-ed why
Retaliation, let 'em  like it's the Fourth July

Now I'm on Ocean Drive sipping codeine with the top down
20 grand on me, lot of jewelry and a Glock nine

Say Young Savage name in a song, it's some shots fired

Everybody making sound

Oh, joys arise, the sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the week
The polyphonic prayer is here, it's all around you
It's all around you out here

And if the whole world is crashing down on you
Fall through space, out of mind with me
Where the emptiness we leave behind on warm air rising
Those are the shadows far away

The falling of the whole empire, it's here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sinks

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet working the machine
Will it spin? Will it soar?
My little dream working the machine

Soothe like a wave
And crash far
Closing in on the moon
And who we are

Little memories
Your little feet working the machine
Will it spin? Will it soar?
My little dream working the machine

Soothe like a wave
And crash far
Closing in on the moon
And who we are

Lord hear me now
Junk boats and English boys
Crashing out in super marts
Electric fences and guns

You swallow me
I'm a pill on your tongue

here on the nineteenth floor

The neon lights make me come
And late in a star's life
It begins to explode
And all the people in a dream
Wait for the machine

Pick the shit up leave it clean
Kid, hang over here
What you learning in school?
Is the rise of an Eastern sun

Gonna be good for everyone?
The radio station disappears
Music turning to thin air
The DJ was the last to leave
She had well conditioned hair,
was beautiful, but nothing really was there

City's breaking down on a camel's back.
They just have to go 'cause they don't know wack
So all you fill the streets it's appealing to see
You wont get out the county, 'cos you're bad and free
You've got a new horizon It's ephemeral style.
A melancholy town where we never smile.
And all I wanna hear is the message beep.

My dreams, they've got to kiss, because I don't get sleep, no.

Windmill, Windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride
It is tinking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me

Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Laughing gas these hazmats, fast cats
Lining them up-a like ass cracks
Lay these ponies at the track
Its my chocolate attack.
Shit, I'm stepping in the heart of this here
Care bear bumping in the heart of this here
Watch me as I gravitate
Hahahahahahaa.
Yo, we gonna go ghost town
This motown
With yo sound
You're in the place
You gonna bite the dust
Can't fight with us
With yo sound
You kill the INC.
So don't stop, get it, get it

Until you're Jet Ahead.
Yo, watch the way I navigate
Hahahahahhaa

Sh-shake it, shake it, Ahahah
Sh-shake it, shake it, Ahahah
Sh-shake it, shake it, Ahahah
Sh-shake it, shake it, Ahahah

Windmill, Windmill for the land.
Turn forever hand in hand
Take it all there on your stride

It is tinking, falling down
Love forever love is free
Let's turn forever you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?

Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady

Watch me navigate
Ahahahahahhaa.
Don't stop, get it, get it
We are your captains in it
Steady, watch me navigate
Ahahahahahhaa.

Wooh!
Wooh!
Wooh!
All right!

I wanna be your teacher in the team
Get to come in naked, cause it's clean
I wanna be your make-up, with the seam
Just take a shaker, make it mean

I won't get over the damn
Cause it's just like that old mile
Every four o' clock in the morning
I think I'm gonna die

Check I'll hold you
I wish it was you
Gotta get a cat up a CK
Cause that's where we're at
Gotta give a car the beetles
Cause they're not sad

But I won't get over it now
Cause it's half-drawn on the shout
It could be four o' clock in the morning
If you wish it'd got no style

I gotta shit out like I was never
On the fallest town to be
I could wish this way forever
But I ever gonna be clean
No, I can't get shot
Albeit, no!
I can't get shot
Albeit, no!
I can't get shot!

Wooh!

Wanna grow to keep it in June
Gonna make it easy for you
Wanna be the carever in the coal
Just get this on with
Everything the kids enjoy

But I won't get over it soon
Cause there ain't light at full noon
Cause at four o' clock in the morning
I got cheering up to do
If not, you get a real shot
It's just like walls I never drived
But I go: "Wooh!"
I just go: "Wooh!"
We all go: "Wooh!"
Yeah!
We all go: "Wooh!"
All right!

Eager man, that's all

Summer don't know me
He just let me love in myself
Cause I do know, Lord, from you that
Just died, yeah

I saw that day, lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine, maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see

Money won't get there
Ten years passed tonight you'll flee
If you do that, I'll be some
To find you

I saw that day, lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine, maybe in time

The feeling in
Guts to the brain
It means you got it coming and you ain't got a chain
Their only attire
Is a typical vice
But if it gets you well, well you ain't being nice, no

So follow the lives
Till they cut up your eyes
You won't be even seeing if you ain't growing lies
Then bought all the shit
That should never be sold
They put a gun above it and a narrow behold

We are the happy landfill
We are the happy landfill
All right!

This morning you've got time for a hot home-cooked breakfast
Delicious and piping hot in only 3 microwave minutes

Are you kidding?

Yo, pretty packages of frosted delights
Look, it comes with a toy, he he, I like that
I wanna number 4, a number 6, and throw in a plastic dough-nut
Just enjoy the gritty crunch, that tastes just like chicken

Wrappers of many bite sizes
Man, are you freaking blind? That's a rock, all mixed in the potful
Momma's homemade from scratch, well, not quite
Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders
Don't waste time with your net
Our net worth is set, ready, go, many know others, what?

We be the colors of the mad and the wicked
We be bad, we re-brick it with the 24-hour sign
Shower my habits while you dine like rabbits
With the crunchy, crunchy carrots - Oh, that's chicken
Gotta have it super fast!

A whole lot of breakfast you got time for!

Super fast, super fast, I come in last
But just in time for breakfast
Keep us through, keep us through, forever blue
The night, the night throws at us

Aluminum, I crush your fun
Aluminum
The sea is radioactive
The sea is radioactive

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers
No snail thing too quick for his water-feeders

To the dark, dark seas
Comes the only whale
Watching ships go by
It's the day we try

It doesn't know, it's a Casio on a plastic beach

It's styrofoam deep sea landfill

It's automated computer speech

On a really hot day?
When the call got made
You've gone away

Now first of all where I'm supposed to start
When I first met you man another nigga had your heart
But I'ma player so you know a playa played his part
Smooth talkin', conversation took a nigga broad
I'm on the road doin' shows, seem like we fell apart
She think the nigga fuckin' groupies, I'm just grindin' hard
Your family said we wouldn't last but we beat the odds
Bonnie and Clyde, she was with a nigga stealin' cars
These streets so dirty I just want someone who really there
Can't fake love, just want someone who really care
Be loyal to me, want somebody I ain't gotta share
Open your eyes, baby girl, real niggas rare
All my dog ways, headin' for them in the kennel
I'ma savage to these niggas but to her I'm gentle

When you're smoking tinfoil in the morning
It's gonna be a cold day
When you're keeping everything inside you
It can only hurt you

Unrelated sounds
The sun will shine again
You hold it in your hands

This land is a young land let it stay that way
This pollution only turns you into something
You don't want to see in the water
A reflection of them that you receive

You don't own the sun
And the sun won't shine again
So maybe you're all in love
With aluminium

The cling and a clang
Is the metal in my head when I walk
I hear a sort of this tinging noise
Cling clang, the cling clang
So many things happen while walking
The metal in my head clangs and clings as I walk
Freaks my balance out, so the natural thought
Is just clogged up, totally clogged up
So we need to unplug these dams
And make the the natural flow
It sort of freaks me out
We need to unplug the dams
You cannot stop the natural flow of thought
With a cling and a clang
Wake me up again until
We're aluminium
You hold it in your hands

The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again
The sun will shine again

Waiting by the mailbox, by the train
Passing by the hills 'til I hear the name
I'm looking for a saw to cut these chains in half

And all I want is someone to rely on this
As thunder comes a rolling down
Someone to rely on this
As lightning comes a staring in again

I'll wait to be forgiven
Maybe I never will
My star has left me
To take the bitter pill

That shattered feeling
Well, the cause of, it's a lesson learned
Just don't know if I could roll into the sea again
Just don't know if I could do it all again
She said, "It's true"

Waiting in my room and I lock the door
I watch the colored animals across the floor
And I'm looking from a distance
And I'm listening to the whispers

And oh, it ain't the same
When you're falling out of feeling
And you're falling in and caught again
Caught again

I'm caught again in the mystery
You're by my side, but are you still with me?
The answer's somewhere deep in it
I'm sorry but you're feeling it

But I just have to tell you
That I love you so much these days
Have to tell you
That I love you so much these days, it's true

My heart is in economy
Due to this autonomy
Rolling in and caught again
Caught again, caught again, caught again
My heart is in economy

Due to this autonomy

Rolling in and caught again
Caught again

Well, I'm building a highway back
Back to the heart of things
No love left to walk back
Back to the heart of things

So, I'm building above and back
All our city gone red
When I get it all from you
I'm gonna bid it all true, true

It's so cold when I say goodbye
People holding a meaning, why?
But you never let the car get in
For holding on the sound of swim

Did you want a wind and a sail
It would take a boat
All of the pity and woe
Say what you want, don't bring
Anything back to me

Cause I'm old, I will say goodbye
Hoping to run out of our own life
If I get a lot from you
I'll make it all come true

Dream of my world
i live on my world
going off my head, down to, somewhere
i'm going on a dance all tune
in a pressure today
i blew a bad man away, today
higher ground, had to be told
i blew a man away
brother, sister too
do what you must do
don't trust people you meet
they might promise you
that the river ain't deep
dream on the street
people passing though me, yes they do
well my friend
want my heart mend
i'm gonna bring it all back to you
brother, sister too
do what you must do
don't trust people you meet
they might promise you
that the river ain't deep

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Some kind of metal, made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades, they wear phony clothes
They sit with our picture up until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of soul
Some kind of mixture
Some kind of gold
Some kind of majesty
Some chemical load

Well, me, I like plastics and digital foils
To wrap up the sound and protect the girls
From the spiritual poisons you spill at night
Like phony clothes but I really like my...

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature, some kind of soul
Comes from within us

Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture, some kind of gold
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust

Some kind of metal, made up from glue
Some kind of plastic, I could wrap around you
The needy eat man-mades, they wear phony clothes
They sit with our picture up until they grow old

Some kind of nature
Some kind of nature, some kind of soul
Come from within us

Oh Lord, forgive me
Some kind of mixture, some kind of gold
It's got to come and find us
All we are is dust

Planet of the apes

The revolution will be televised
And the pollution from the ocean
Now with devotion
Push peace and keep it in motion

Kids, gather around
Yeah, I need your focus
I know it seems like the world is so hopeless

It's like wonderland

Now fascinate me
Picture and animate me
'Cause I'm rollin'
Deep holein'
Click clacking
Crack-a-lacking
Full packing
Mo' stacking
Acting a fool when I teach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach

Mirror mirror on the wall
Boss Dawg
Give it to 'em
Get involved
Turn it up
Speed it up
Slow it up
Underground where the under us undercut
Shipped up
Shipped out
Swimmin' with the sharks
Put my gills up
Turn the wheels up
Real tough
Drinkin' lemonade in the shade
Getting blade with a gang of prilgrims

Yeah, just like that
Belly floppin' lockin' while I'm rockin' in the bubble bath
And I'm just like math
Fozo's added up that get you more cash
So quick, so fast
All the kids say they love it when I make 'em laugh
Welcome to the world of the Plastic Beach

On the cloud of unknowing
My world seems open
Every satellite up here is watching
But I was here from the very start
Trying to find a way to your heart

All the days are forgetting
They've gone out with the tide
Lost at sea somewhere, waiting
Like setting suns at the rodeo
Trying to find someone you'll never know

Oh, sinking love
On the cloud of unknowing
Every satellite up here is watching
Waiting to see what the morning brings
May bring sunshine on its wings

Summer don't know me no more
He got mad, tiresome.

Summer don't know me
He just left me low in my self
'Cause I too know love,
from you that
Just died. Yeah.

I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
Maybe in time
You'll want to be mine

Don't stop the buck when it comes
It's the dawn, you'll see

Money won't get there
Ten years past and now
You'll flee

If you do that
I'll be strong
To find you

I saw that day,
Lost my mind
Lord, I'm fine
And in time
You'll want to be mine
If you do that
I'll be strong

Hey, look, yo

No castaway, no survivor
I ain't lost and this ain't shipwrecked
I feel small in this big wide world
And mommy ain't said, 'Honey, I shrunk the kids' yet

I ain't Jesus but I'm walking on water
There's no bums here, there's no wall 'cause
I can break out of jail with a lighter
So is there any point in making laws blood?

This ain't Atlantis, are you sure?
I nearly suffocated when I touched the shore
No rain, condoms get poured
And up the road, you'll never guess who I saw

It's K.A. look, skip on the beat like Ali in the gym
Honey, I'm home, this is where I wanna live
Disbanded like leave, oh
On the d-low

I don't know if it's greener but it's green though
On the other side of the fence, bind to the ends
Look, no fence, no stress, no rent, no supervision shit, this real flow
Where the women look hot but the beach cold

And the speech goes like, "Hi little lady
Sex on the beach, wanna try for a baby"
Word in the village, I'm a little bit crazy
Swag up on a hundred degrees, no eighty

Look, if heaven had a VIP
This is it, white sand, blue sea
But I don't know who they are
And I'm damn sure they don't know me
But I come in peace

Cool, white flag, white flag

No war, no guns
No corps, just life

Just love, no hate
Just fun, no ties

Just me and my mind
Just me and my wife

But tell me if I'm dreaming
'Cause I don't wanna wake up till the evening
And I don't wanna be left sleeping
From all the diseases that I breathe in

Look, respect the island, no stealing
And don't bring religion here, no three kings
It's great and we ain't leaving
We come on in peace, sing

White flag, white flag

I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
the future is coming on

I ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

Drums'll fall heavy like anvil weight
higher than your high scape goat cheese
order, order, please
run, joe, run, there are criminals behind you
side-winders and snakes your moves define you
remind you:
how I wish my brother del was here
catalog originals, the expert's clear
shear legs of lamb your whole style's am
we are tons and tons and you are just a gram
the hand of irrelevance, banned from the benefits
cancelin' your visa
pushing 'til you be like ah
these-za, 30 below freeze-za
caesar got stabbed cause he was a bi-otch
gia
piano key-za, select to touch the ivory
Isee it in black and white
it's an easy ideology
we sigh, and sweat, and tear; save the blood for valentine
tell me how you're feelin' at the end of the rhyme

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
the future is coming on

I ain't happy, i'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
the future is coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on
it's coming on, it's coming on

They say I have no meaning, no purpose
so why do I exist?
I purchase me some bracelets to protect my wrists
I hid that rope, i flushed those pills
all those opposing me cause they can't get the deals
I catch them in a pickle trying to steal home plate
when i got the home field advantage
don't think they can manage
stop this shine, cross this line
you will find it didn't have to go
leading out to nowhere
faster than a bullet train
I got me a lois lane; I'm feeling like i'm superman
here in the yucatan
I yell it from the studio, loud and clear
howl in here
explosion, damage, corrosion
it's what remains in your theory
I'm in this emissary
til the end of the love letter
we'll go get her
"can't" has no place in my vocabulary
why you even doubt it?
It wasn't necessary

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
the future is coming on

I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad

Staying low key, still they know me
Smoking OG, and I blow it by the O-Z

My J's super old, Rick Owens, no sleeves

And We gon' take shots until someone has to drive us home
Come from a place where they do tote that chrome
Smile on they face, but ain't nothing a game
Stacking that paper, don't get in their way
Or Rat-tat-tat

Banging my gang like uh

And if you trying to fuck with her, I'mma tax that
Ass all on the floor, I'm trynna pour it up bitch
Lean on my dick so slow it up bitch
And the police trynna pull up on the scene
Then they ask you what you seen

A hundred niggas right behind me that's the drum line
All you hear is ‘blat, blat', hit it one time
Fuck a punch line, nigga had bread since the lunch line

Open season, just nigga give me the reason
To bust, and just let it squeeze and
My rope-a-dope is the meanest

Hoping I don't get subpoenas but I…

Getting head till it ache, that's a motherfucking headache

Niggas in the back motherfucker poppin' bottles
Chasing bad bitches and them niggas throwing dollars
Louis V down from my head to my toes
C-Murder in the pen, and that iron getting swole
Never gave a fuck 'bout no niggas wanna hate
Keep the chopper in the car, case a nigga wanna play
She showed me the titties, I call them bitches Dhali
I know she a freak, cause she gone off molly
Pushing 160 when I'm riding in the go
You ain't from round here, nigga better walk slow, or get smoked

Like I ain't on 1, 2, 3 pac
Like I ain't finna bust with my homeboy make the fucking beat drop
Bustin' a cap in the wack when I'm rappin'
You really need to trust in the fact that I'm back and I'm slappin'
The industry for ducking the cat when he rap with a passion
When I'm in this piece, I crush in a fashion

Like I ain't never ate in this game 
Like I ain't never seen and had me some big things
Like I ain't been around the world and with so many different girls
And kinky parties that it could lift the spirit of Rick James 
Like I ain't a fixture and never knew Twista
And never did music for the Alpha Dog picture
Like I never script the pledge in the scripture
Or had a hit song 'bout my my own liquor mixture
Do it like I wasn't a starter that was on the Carter 
Wasn't in art of my cousin, the Water 
Nothing was bartered,
We're bussing and touchin' the heart of people
That's loving the heart of stuffing ain't no charted 

Like I never got signed 
Not a one, not a two but three times 
Like I never did get the cheddar or see shine
Like it's sleep time for peeps' minds on T9
Like, if these rhymes really never ever happened 
'Til right now, like pow, I got it crackin'
With the pen and pad, without no back end
Tryna stack and get action and pull
The cash in is the way that I'm rappin'

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the 'Zou, like I, like I ain't

Toured with the Jay Rock, with the homie K Dot
Like I ain't never had the allure for the play slots
Stressing, like I ain't step in the session with the Seven
Never guessin' the effin' cure is to spray thots 
Like I never had a shot 
Or a song with the white guy Dre got 
Like I didn't have a lay lock,
Never went on set of Ballers with Mr. Baywatch 

Like I didn't meet Trav yet, like I never had assets
Bad with the pen, but never cashed checks
Rapping like I ain't even close to havin' the bag yet 
Like I'm tryna be the best up in this hip-hop 
And do a track with the king of Atlanta, T.I.P.-top
Then turn around and switch it up and do big rock
Tryna ride all the way up to my homie in Slipknot 

Cheah! Like I never heard fans yell it
Not the calm, not the worst, even Angelic 
Before they told me that I can't sell it
Before I went to the reunion of fam Nelly
Like I didn't have this new watch 
And it never would tic and never do toc 
Like I'm rapping myself to learning brew hops
Rapping like I ain't never did a record with 2Pac

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the 'Zou, like I, like I ain't

Skipping my job, yeah, like this is a process
Try'na get from the projects, so I spit like I got next
And I trip if you object, like I'm itchin' to fly Tech
Whipping in kitchens with Pyrex, to the mission that God set
For me, rippin' these quick and will not rest
Like no flippin' Techn9cian is obsessed 

Like I didn't know when I was droppin' 
Independent music, I wasn't toppin' 
And all the bad bitches wasn't jockin'
I rap like I didn't know I did a record with Hopsin 
They call me Tecca N9na, I'ma shoot this
If you're dissin', you really don't wanna do this
Niggas wanna try me, then you're gonna lose it
I rap like I never did a record with Joyner Lucas 

Like I never knew Maestro's
Like I didn't know Trae was a asshole
Like I didn't have a stash full of cash flow
Rappin' like I'm back in the past with my afro
Like I never ever knew Strange would put up the
Name Tech N9ne in my shoe strings 
Like I didn't know I was spittin' the butane
And I grew fame with the homie Bobby and 2 Chainz

Like I ain't rich, like I ain't sold
Not a ne'er record Platinum or ne'er Gold
Like I ain't dripped, like I ain't froze
Like I ain't made a quarter mill' for a show
Like I ain't big, like I ain't huge
Like I ain't shit, like I ain't pay dues
Like I ain't full, like I ain't cool
Like I ain't build a empire in the 'Zou, like I, like I ain't

Strange Music
2019 and beyond, baby
This shit crazy

We're not against rap
We're not against rappers
But we are against those thugs 

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone Your feelin' the strength of the rump
Step up, hear the funk of the jump that the thugstas feel
Just be thuggin, straight buzzin, lovin yo peoples cause we so real
Chill, better bring yo weapon, when steppin
Bring on that ammunition, trippin' on sip
Not to mention, never knew no competition
But i gotta get mine, so scream out, mo, and let me hear ya holla
Not about that mighty dollar
Roll with the bone, mo' thugs will follow
Chain gang, remains the same
Flamin my dank and drinkin brew
Thinkin about hangin, clockin my bank, and thuggin trues, foo's

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone Get ready for the bone and the mo thug, bustas
You know me as a hustla
Try to creep and get beat, maybe six feet, peep, gotta put them under
Straight jackets, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now, livin in my black trench vest
You gotta be down there bang bang
Come and get this teachin, ya soldiers how thugstas must slack
Me drinkin me brew till me skull crack, when we on our way back

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone Now follow me now, roll, stroll off deep in the land
Well, creep if you can, take another swig to the brain 
Loc'in, steady chokin off that potent smoke
and runnin from the po-po now
Gotta get up with my thugstas, right turn to the double glock
Pull to the curb, smoke with my hustlas
Puff, puff puff to the brain shot
Love P.O.D.ed and tweeded, gotta get another case for my trunk
Old English, really don't need it, but in case my trues wanna get drunk
They pump bone, so leave 'em alone
You don't wanna get shut down
Thug runnin the nine-quad,
and you better beleive they be wantin this thug style
So what now? see the bone thug claim,
thug never gonna change, so flame up
Sit back and just smoke the same cut,
Leatherface on the creep, I came up

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone Gotta give it on up to the glock glock
Pop pop, better drop when them buckshot blow
The bone in me never no ho, so no creepin up outta the ziplock
So sin, sip gin, and lil' mo heart run up, nut up
And flipped in, than slipped the clip in, mistakin' the bloody victims
Ever if ya test nuts, to the chest and put em to rest
And, but I won't test bucks, put a hole up into me vest
And gotta get through my soul,
but they won't budge, mud, drug me victim
The blood in me runnin' my mental, the thug in me, stuck in me
Keepin' it simple, the bone in me runnin with thugs so
To the temple, buck when you duck to the thuggish ruggish T's
St. Claire P's to appeal to the G's
And a buck to all my enemies

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone We got Layzie and
We got Krayzie
Bizzy's in the house
Wish is in the house
And Flesh
And Tasha
Cleveland's definiteley in the house

It's the Thuggish Ruggish Bone

The life I live is a fast one
But even if I'm getting home-pies, I would have some
'Course I think I'm top of the sport I do bar-none
Won't change a thing and I can
Still have a chart run, still be a gargon
You grow up as a kid, you're looking up to your older
And then you lose respect because you see what they show ya
I wish I didn't have to be the one that they looked to
I don't condone the war that the young ones are put through
Things have changed now but I come from the hood too
People say they never see me there but I'm hood dude
Say the word lemon, I'll be there with the good food
Certain man you see and they are not in a good mood
I just let the world go by and I'll pace it
If I draw a good picture then another can trace it
Mother dropped me in the world only for me to grace it
I'm gonna leave my mark on this earth place it, advanced not basic

If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, oh
I tell them no man is an island
Well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence

I wanna see us all on one time
But if I'm on the bill then someone gotta spit one rhyme
What they tryna do is light the show with me one sign
Can't help the world will your only one mind, only got one life
If you don't reverse and take it serious, one mic
Deny you of your legacy and they ain't got one right
Well I record a batch of nine tracks in one night
I work through the hours and then I meet with the sunlight
I know I got power but I'm tryin' to channel it
I know that we can make the music, money, and manage it
Even starting from the floor I'll find the flow and unravel it
Every time I watch the news blood it's making me sad a bit
I really need to change the channel over to happy vibes
N-dubz, fazer, tulisa, dappy vibes
Whoever is in the lime-light's got a good appetite
I rate ya, how am I gonna hate ya? Harry right, huh

If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, oh
I tell them no man is an island
Well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence

If I could, I would change
Life's a battle I'm only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain't worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, oh
I tell them no man is an island
Well you will think we are but I'm breaking the silence

They'll never be the same as me (
No, they could never be)
Froze to death, my diamonds screaming RIP

They'll never be the same 
Scream, Auf Wiedersehen
Psych out, leave this place in flames 

This is Gucci that you've never seen 
Label say the kid's on fire, I'm dripping kerosene
How'd I look so clean when I got all these felonies?
I feel like a human jukebox with these melodies
Don't get mad, I get drops 
Meet and greet with my opps 
Call for guns and not cops 
Dem man know it's on top 
See my drink, it's remix 
My Latin bae be too thick 
I'm wavy, baby, don't trip 
She suck me 'til she seasick

You couldn't pay me if you wanted, I'm a rockstar 
Just got a plaque for singing, mummy, I'm a popstar 
My Fendi scarf keep spinning, made it helicopter
Hey mama, went and bust my wrist, I need a doctor 
And I got magnum on my liver 
If you order smoke, it's coming next day, I deliver 
Need to buy a coat, 'cause all these boys make me shiver
Grab the waist, the pussy started running like a river


They'll never be the same as me

Froze to death, my diamonds screaming RIP

They'll never be the same 
Scream, Auf Wiedersehen
Psych out, leave this place in flames 

White Air Forces 
Beamers, Bentleys, and Porsches
Take my girl for three courses
Money fever, I'm nauseous, yeah
Pop the shooters, we're lawless 
Psych out, words to my chorus 
My new girl with my diamonds twinning
'Cause they're both of them flawless, yeah
Nagato, I'm in pain 
Rollie filled up with rain 
Dare you reach for my chain 
Turn the boy to a stain, yeah
YSL on my shades 
We ain't in the same lane 
Had the bag since I came here
I don't fuck, I want brain, yeah

You couldn't pay me if you wanted, I'm a rockstar 
Just got a plaque for singing, mummy, I'm a popstar 
My Fendi scarf keep spinning, made it helicopter
Hey mama, went and bust my wrist, I need a doctor 
And I got magnum on my liver 
If you order smoke, it's coming next day, I deliver 
Need to buy a coat, 'cause all these boys make me shiver
Grab the waist, the pussy started running like a river


They'll never be the same as me
Froze to death, my diamonds screaming RIP

They'll never be the same

Me and you together is something we could go through

But you gonn fall in love and i hope that u know this
Coz once we get to ... then you know that its hopeless

We can make this public or keep it on a low low
If its on the low though nobody has to know though
We be getting naked hella faded of the drow yo'
Slow whine ... tek time

Day n night. I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think the first but surely finish last, last

Cause day n nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day n night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night
Day n night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change.
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

Hold the phone.
The lonely stoner missed his solo doe low
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shake
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a beep, beep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

Cause day n night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day n night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night
Day n night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night.
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

Slow mo
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue
The sun is shinin man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of…
To free his mind in search of…
To free his mind in search of…

Day n night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day n night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night
Day n night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, ah ah at night

They're lovey and thurston howellin
The grasshopper unit is prowellin
And rufus is back home growellin
For all of y'all that are dozin
On hornblower's lederhosen
Like walt disney he is frozen
And then the swiss hall of fame he goes in
Cause when he's out in space carousin
Pick up my mic and start joustin
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a hal 9000

Can't, won't, don't stop rockin to the rhythm 'cause I get down cause i

Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again
Inspector clouseau and derek flint
Nothin but sparks ignitin'
Check two one two mic testin
This one goes out to dechen
Rise fallen fighters take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian sharks fin
Try to keep my life non violent

Mario rewind the tape and punch him in
Like chuck d with the where you never been I'm in

Can't, won't, don't stop rockin to the rhythm 'cause I get down cause I get
I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep movin', movin on

Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
Ooh my my something's really wrong
The p.a. sound is deafenin
Bitin mcs I'm oustinin
With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin
So on your way out please take a mint
Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin
Add a little flange and phase in
Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin
I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin
They're gonna put me in the b.i.n.
And if I die notify the next of kin

It's like that y'all

It's like a flag at half mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last as past is past
Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
Used over and over till they were tired and torn

I like a broken clock that can't tell time
Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes
Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
I like a band that planned and planned and planned

And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And snatched up the worm helpless to fight
And brought it back to the nest
Singing microphone check

One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test

It's like sand in one hand, you can't hold for long
I like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
I like fudge and caramel they're not the same
And it's a shame all you talk is game

You act like a diamond waiting to be set
In a gold ring, as if, I bet
As time goes by in this give and take
As long as I learn I will make mistakes

Now what do I want? What do I need?
Why do I want it? What's in it for me?
It's the imagery of technology
Is what you get is what you see
Don't worry your mind, when you give it your best

One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk

I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong?
The ship is docking, inter-lockin
And up-rockin electro-shocking

We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it till the break of dawn

Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame

Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf Du Pap
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Mike D with the master plan
Ooh my my and thank you ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream Ooh god damn
The creme de la creme is who I am

MCA where have you been?
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim

Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play Defender, I could be your hyper space

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

From the Hudson river out to the Nile

Well, if you battle me I feel revile

Well, I gotta keep it going keep it going full steam
To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean
With the tough guy style I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme

Mario C likes to keep it clean 
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam 
Keep on rappin, 'coz that's my dream 
Thank Mo D for sticking to the beats

Now when it comes to envy y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the ryhme routine
Another dimension, new galaxy
Intergalactic planetary

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic

Were from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
Your rhymes are spread just like a pox
'Coz the music is loud like an electric shock

I am known to do the wop 
Also known for the Flintstone Flop 
Tammy D gets biz on the crops (crops
Beastie Boys known to let the beat, mmm, drop

Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If I rap soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack D.J Ad Rock

If you try to knock me you'll get mopped
I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees start shakin' and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic
Intergalactic, planetary, planetary Intergalactic

Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension

Do it

Coffin going around Have you seen mister Brown
Coffin going around going around the town
Have you seen mister Brown
Whispering voices whispering voices
Whispering voices have you seen mister Brown
They who want to control always lose control
They who wants everything always lose everything
Coffin going around Have you seen mister Brown in town
Have you seen mister Brown
They who want total control always lose control
Some always lose their sole for silver and gold
Silver and gold are by none
Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Rise up and walk rise up and walk
Rise up and walk rise up and walk
A weepin' time weepin' time and reapin' time
Weepin' time and creepin' time
Reap what you sow
Rockin' comin' from the weepin' mind
and all that I reap is mine
So you can not reap what is mine
Say
Was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
Black ganja cigarette
Kindly weed and ganja marijuana lung's breath
Rise up and walk rise up and clap
Rise up and hap rise up and lift up your cap
Lift up your cap and rise up and hap
Do the thunder clap great hall of fire on the sky
And reap your time weep your mind
Weepin' time reapin' time harvest harvest time
You reap what you sow I reap what I sow
Coffin going around have you seen mister Clown
He used to call himself mister Brown and king sat down
He no longer miss the town
He not know that I miss the crown and missed the ground
What's comin' up from under ground we'll weep in time

It's like a flag at half mast as frames click fast
Not a thing will last as past is past
Like stacks of thoughts that got played and worn
Used over and over till they were tired and torn

I like a broken clock that can't tell time
Like a thick ass book that's filled with wack rhymes
Like a scorching blaze that burned the sand
I like a band that planned and planned and planned

And flew down like a raven in the dark of night
And snatched up the worm helpless to fight
And brought it back to the nest
Singing microphone check

One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test

It's like sand in one hand, you can't hold for long
I like scheming on a plan that goes all wrong
I like fudge and caramel they're not the same
And it's a shame all you talk is game

You act like a diamond waiting to be set
In a gold ring, as if, I bet
As time goes by in this give and take
As long as I learn I will make mistakes

Now what do I want? What do I need?
Why do I want it? What's in it for me?
It's the imagery of technology
Is what you get is what you see
Don't worry your mind, when you give it your best

One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test
One two, one two this is just a test

Like stacks of thoughts
Got tired and worn
Used over and over
'Til they were tired and torn
Like a broken clock
That can't tell time
I like a thick-ass book
Mine, that's mine
Like a billion...

That'll be fine.

Alright.

It'll be fun more than fine, I think.

No I think it'll be fun and fine.

See.

That's what we're tryin' to get.

That's the, that's... you're in that place again. In that special place again. Oh I'm so happy to be in that special place again. I love the place I'm in. I'm in that perfect headspace again.

Doon goon goon duh-doon gah-doon doon doon...

Don't get in my headspace baby!

I'm barely Human

Just stroke my ego
Call me your hero
I'm damned to be this good

I'm barely human

Cold heart
Sinister sicking ya so-so art
If ya seeking a beating, I can treat and give heapins
Make your 'fro blow 'part before yo' flow starts
Wanna be chopping 'em, knocking 'em all in coffins
And I'm stopping ya slow go kart when I go Mozart
Intricate, never vintage in my sentences
I'm gonna make a bro go shart
Look at me, I'm gonna favor the yeti but with a machete
You better be ready, you in the medi of a killing
I'm deadly when I shred these
Somebody check my head please, I'm edgy
And I'm steady giving hella loving
And I thank you to my niggas who led me to the red beef
Barely human, rarely you in the midst of some scary ruins
Until ya try to swipe my independence, Harry Truman

The Nina, the Nickel, we coming very soon and
Building the wack rapper cemetery to bury you in

Just stroke my ego
Call me your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human
You stroked my ego

Now I'm your hero
I'm damned to be this good
I'm barely human

King Nickel
 spending old money, the cake's stale
I beam triple like three lasers on three pistols on a weight scale
It seem simple, I'm pro-meth, I'm pro-magazine
This literature unfold half
Your team lean with you and I'm a nomad
Roaming out in the street killing MC's pencils, making 'em rethink
What they write and might end up in yo' pad
I'm getting dome in my kingdom where
I promise it'll be no crowning 
The flow harder than Medusa postpartum
The father of the child's coast guarding post-crowning
I'm getting money my nigga, it's funny that nobody thought of you
And if it truly is true to music and induce it to life then my future
Will sound like autotune
Bad grammar and y'all be fucking up no commas
For you to compare me to 'em
He would have to be out of his mind if he barely human

Hello.
It's times like this when I just can't stop
Can't wind your body without the body rock
Got schemes schematics blue prints on file
You gotta have dreams to make it all worthwhile
So as I take my time and realign
I wonder what it is I hope to find
I don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast
But I'm intercontinental when I eat french toast
Adrock with the New Addition Edition
Gettin' on down for the year 2000
A slight distraction can get you paid
And when it comes to that type shit I paved the way

B-Boys to the early morn
B-Girls be rockin' on and on
B-Girls to the break of dawn
B-Boys be rockin' on and on

Dogs love me cause I'm crazy sniffable
I bet you never knew I got the ill peripheral
In your home I'm cloned I'm on your headphones
I love it when you spazz out all alone
Cause I'm that fool that broke the key
I'm unlockable so don't check me
Got weight on my shoulders and things on my mind
The sky is falling and I'm falling behind
So I synthesize sounds as I patch my brain
Insane mind games move quick like flames
So now I wonder how sometimes you never know
Who be rockin' y'all in stere-ere-o in stere-ere-o in stere-ere-o in stereo

No time like the present to work shit out
That's what I'm going on and on and on about
Not fakin' just makin' beats in the dungeon
Keep that shit funky cause the odor is pungent
No shame in my game just par for the path
I try to hone my craft because at hands the task
But I find I'm not playing with a full deck
I'm up to my neck like Toulouse Lautrec
All I wanna know is when is checkout time
So I could be in heaven with the rhythm rock rhyme
And when I'm with my man Shadi rock at the gates
We'll be rockin' rhythms over disco breaks

B-Boys to the early morn
B-Girls be rockin' on and on
B-Girls to the break of dawn
B-Boys be rockin' on and on
On and on
On and on... 

*Y una vez un gran rey
Que tenia muchas tierras,
un castillo y tambien un amor
Y una vez un gran rey
Que tenia muchas tierras,
un castillo y tambien un amor
O el rey
O o el rey*

Things get hectic quick
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block

Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams

So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control

Remote control
Remote control

Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end

Say, living in this city of pure confusion
People mislead by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction

Play or fold, love is bold
What is the future that will unfold?
Some like it hot, others like it cold
But we all want to hold the remote control

Remote control
Remote control
Remote control
Remote control

Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Distractions booming in sensuround

Like a rainy day's Earth, it won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life seems to stall
So never be ungrateful y'all

So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King I've got the crazy hairdo
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote control

Dear Alex and Marilyn
The Lovely and Thurston howlin'
The grasshopper unit is prowlin'
And Rufus is back home growlin'
For all of y'all that be dozin'
On Hornblower's lederhosen
Like Walt Disney, he is frozen
And in the Swiss Hall of Fame he goes in
Cause when he's out in space carousin'
Pick up my mic and start joustin'
My name plate medallion
Says never trust a Hal 9000

Check the horizontal hold and check the tint
Are these three fools back at it again
Inspector Clouseau and Derek Flint
Nothin but sparks ignitin'
Check two one two mic testin'
This one goes out to Dechen
Rise fallen fighters take your stance again
Don't think too much about the color of skin
Order in vegetarian sharks fin
Try to keep my life non violent
Mario, rewind the tape and punch me in
Like Chuck D with the where you never been I'm in

I'm a long way from where I've been but I gotta keep
movin'
Movin' on

Ooh my my I'm really not feeling it
Ooh my my something's really wrong 
The p.a. sound is deafenin'
Bitin MCs I'm oustinin'
With spinach in your teeth you're grinnin'
So on your way out please take a mint
Got the studio to throw a craze in
The basslines Yauch just lays in
This song is the grass you're grazin'
Add a little flange and phase in
Don't get mad 'cause I'm beguilin'
I'm off the hook so don't bother dialin'
They're gonna put me in the b.i.n.
And if I die notify the next of kin

It's like that y'all

Movin' on

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

Transhypnotic robotic can't stop it
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket

Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back

I'm the king of Boggle there is none higher
I get 11 points off the word 
Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it cause that's my biz

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
Deny, till we die, ooh my my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply

Second by second and minute by minute
It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes

So tell me what you need that you have got
Feeding on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along

We're all connected like a Leggo set
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try to come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked

I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like, hello nasty where you been
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon

I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit 'cause it just makes me strong

Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

What's pleasing to the eye
In the delusion of all my sight
Is not what I find when I reach into the light
I have lost my mind

I'm walking through time
Deluded as the next guy
Pretending and hoping to find
That distant peace of mind

I don't know
Who does know
There is no
Where to go

It's not so simple as I try to wish
But then again what is?
There is no other worthy quest
So on I go

I don't know
Who does know
There is no
Where to go

I don't know
Who does know
Where to go
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know

Oh my goodness, this record's incredible.

<|endoftext|>

Author: Beastie Boys

I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm scheming rhyme against reason like it was flow against know
But beyond the concepts and emotions that rise
To the interconnectedness that underlies

The lies upon lies have lost their meaning
The plies upon plies of consciousness that is being
Over and over, I fall, I learned to walk from a crawl
It's not sad, it's just the way and the purpose of it all

Now every word that you heard that I said that you felt
Was put in place in the space as they were shuffled and dealt
I steal feels from reels but I pay my respects
Paying compliments and disses and deciphering affects

Words are water as I court her, as she is pristine
Words and mics fall to dust and all that's left is the feelings
I give in and I win I try to never complain
Intentions venture to center and then, they set the stage

But I'll remain sane making gain without pain
Staining trains with names and driving lanes to the refrain
And keep it positive as pains taking as it is

I'll never turn back 'cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back 'cause that's the way I've got to live
I'll never turn back 'cause that's the way I've got to live

So like a cloud carries rain, I'm gonna carry my rhyme
Coming like thunder with lightning timing
No hesitation in gestation of thoughts and plans
Ferment time like wine, no ploys or scams

Like the islands dot the oceans in the endless seas
Ideas coming to me in answer to my pleas
Woke up this morning right out of a dream
Reached for my pen and pad because my mind
Was on a rhyme scheme

What can I do with these bones and flesh?
With these animated thoughts in a world repressed?
I'm going down like the rhythms on the winds of change
I'm keeping calm under pressure like a deep-sea range

I'm flowing prose to cons and cons to pros
I'm like Toucan Sam when I follow my nose
I'm giving shouts to Gandhi, Gravy and King
His Holiness and all enlightened beings

I'll be the one who screams it on the microphone
I'll be the one who brings it inside your home
But the words ain't mine, I just pass 'em along
For Betty Williams and her friends, I sing this song

And more ink from my pen and more tears from my eyes
And more crimes are committed as I say these lines

Wanna sing it with uncle Mike?
Yeah. Peanut butter and jelly

Words comin forth like water from the tap
Clap tracks line the spaces places papers people stack
Back track through the minutes when the thoughts went insane
I pulled the picture off the cover and blew out the mind games

People say this is the playlist of the void non-bound
But I can say this is the plainness of the peace I've found
It's not the sorrow or the pity that we hope to dismantle
It's the cast of past dice lighting both ends of the candles

Scandelescent in the means I have dreamed on the schemes
Reunited in the times of such picturesque scenes
Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify

So I plan and I scam and write it off on my taxes
It's times like these I'll just go with the decisions of the masses
And to the crowds who've come before with their profit massing ways
I took the greed that fucked it up and brought it down to today

With pain I stand sane and remain holding strong
Whilst all around me those who clowned me are now drowning by the throngs
It's illogical the actions that are typically displayed
A set back ain't all that much problem to invade

So I will glow like a lantern on a new moon night
I'll fight violence with these hands that weren't built to fight
But like a furnace burning coal my goals are bound to burn in flames
Whether achieved or dismantled by the agendas displayed

Can I get a witness to testify?
Open your eyes, realize, electrify

And what do you do when
Your man kills himself and
How do I make friends now

And where is my Mom
I need to show her that
She taught me

And please let me
Die an instant death

Ahhhhright y'all, comin' to you with full force. Yo, I'm not on the sauce, but we gonna do it a little something like this.

Never trust a HAL-9000
When it comes to fire, I'm dousin'
Pick up your mic and start joustin'
Prayin' mantis style, not Shaolin
I don't want the capers, I'm frownin'
Order in vegertarian shark's fin
Throwin' chrome-domes in a tail spin
'Cause I don't drink scotch and I don't drink gin
When it comes to books with rhymes within
Packed like sardines in a tin
Tight-ass parties I'm roastin'
Karate-chop some round housin'

Ahh, that was Mario's fault!

I'll stir fry you in my wok
Your knees start shakin' and your fingers pop
Like a pinch on the neck from Mr. Spock

What makes you feel
And why you gotta be
Like you got the right
To look her up and down

What makes this world
So sick and evil
I know you don't know

What makes you feel
Like you got miracle whip appeal
Who made you the judge and jury
Ain't you never heard of privacy

What makes this world
So sick and evil
You figure it out
You figure it out

Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Oh my God now take a look at me
My life line's run by AT and T
They got their wires all up in me
Is push and pull the way it's got to be

Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
My best friend's my own worst enemy
Electricity and gravity

Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me
Once again I'm all wrapped up in me

And me, and me, and me
And me, and me, and me
And me, and me, and me

You know I wish that there was some way
That I could be outside playing basket ball
In the rain and not get wet, wouldn't that be great

Shall we try it one time?
Mikey?

Shall we start on the one, or in the middle of the bar?
No, start on the one.
Okay.

Is that right?
For me, that was too, was that too quick, or?
It might have been right, I might have space.
Let's just try it from the top again and see what happens.

I can't stand it, I know you planned it,
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate.
I can't stand rockin' when I'm in here,
Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear.
So, while you sit back and wonder why,
I got this fuckin' thorn in my side.
Oh my God, it's a mirage!
I'm tellin' y'all it's sabotage!

So-so-so listen up 'cause you can't say nothin'
You'll shut me down with a push of your button?
But yo I'm out, and I'm gone,
I'll tell you now I keep it on and on.

'Cause what you see you might not get,
And we can't bet, so don't you get souped yet.
You're scheming on a thing that's a mirage,
I'm trying to tell you now it's sabotage!

Why!

Our backs are now against the wall.
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage,
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage,
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage,
Listen all y'all, it's a sabotage!

I can't stand it, I know you planned it,
I'm gonna set it straight this Watergate.
But I can't stand rockin' when I'm in this place,
Because I feel disgrace because you're all in my face!
But make no mistakes and switch up my channel,
I'm buddy rich when I fly off the handle.
What could it be? It's a mirage,
You're scheming on a thing that's sabotage

Things get hectic quick
From the satellite dish to your joy stick
It's the night of the living cable box
Wires coming up from around the block

Remote control to change the station
But that won't change your situation
Have you seen what I mean
I'm the little gnome that's in your dreams

So I say this rhyme built by design
To take you beyond space and time
Said who is the man making diamonds out of coal
The man pushing buttons on remote control

Remote control
Remote control

Until your back's up against the wall
You never know yourself that much at all
So you've got to share your love with a friend
That's all that you've got left in the end

Say, living in this city of pure confusion
People mislead by their own illusion
All this action, no satisfaction
We're all linked together like a chain reaction

Play or fold, love is bold
What is the future that will unfold?
Some like it hot, others like it cold
But we all want to hold the remote control

Remote control
Remote control
Remote control
Remote control

Things get hectic quick
All of the sudden I'm in the thick
Too much drama all around
Distractions booming in sensuround

Like a rainy day's Earth, it won't sit still
Sliding on down a hill
Sometimes life seems to stall
So never be ungrateful y'all

So I got a little something for your pay per view
Like Don King I've got the crazy hairdo
We've got cameras on Mars on space patrol
Controlled on Earth by remote control

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

Transhypnotic robotic can't stop it
No limits to this style you know you can't lock it
First you mock it, rock it and then you stock it
But I've got the styles that are always in the pocket

Like a bird floating down on a New York breeze
Every thought in the mind is a planted seed
So watch the mind or the thoughts will stack
Before you know it they're boomeranging on back

I'm the king of Boggle there is none higher
I get 11 points off the word Fools can't see me and that's how it is
And that's how I like it cause that's my biz

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

Time's an illusion as the moments race by
Too fast to really grasp though we may try
Deny, till we die, ooh my my
These thoughts that mislead and then multiply

Second by second and minute by minute
It's like lotto you gotta be in it to win it
Shakin' mind breakin' on their own demise
Lies tax to the max and they'll be feelin those vibes

So tell me what you need that you have got
Feeding on power will make your blood clot
It starts with the greed and then goes all wrong
That's why we can't all just get along

We're all connected like a Leggo set
One equaling one together like a croquette
Whether we have or have not yet met
Well, it ain't no thing and it ain't no sweat

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

You're caught in a panic and it's rattled your brain
The selfish ways just can't maintain
But these are the breaks when you try to come fake
Don't come with the rhymes that you just half baked

I'm the Benihana chef on the SP12
I chop the fuck out the beats left on the shelf
You be like, hello nasty where you been
It's time you brought the grimy beats out the dungeon

I jumped outside the house with my Walkman on
I get so hyped when I hear this song
It's gonna keep me happy like all day long
So go and talk shit 'cause it just makes me strong

Don't grease my palm with your filthy cash
Multinationals spreading like a rash
I might stick around or I might be a fad
But I won't sell my songs for no TV ad

Beatsie Beatsie Boys gettin' live on the spot
Puttin all kinds of shame in the game you got
We keep the party movin to the broad day light
G.e.t.l.i.v.e. alright

What's pleasing to the eye
In the delusion of my sight
Is not what I find when I reach into the light
I have lost my mind
I'm walking through time
Deluded as the next guy
Pretending and hoping to find
That distant peace of mind
I don't know
Who does know?
There is no
Where to go
It's not so simple as I try to wish
But then again what is?
There is no other worthy quest
So on I go
I don't know
Who does know
Where to go?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
Well, that's about it...
In Ster-ere-eo! In Ster-ere-eo!
In Ster-ere-eo! In Ster-ere-eo!
In Ster-ere-eo! In Ster-ere-eo!

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin with the lyrics and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw

At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
That I'm well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MC's are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we here we come like dum ditty dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches

The sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody let's show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower

Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate

Let's try to negotiate
Oh, let's try to negotiate

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Let me get some action from the back section
We need body rocking not perfection
Let your back bone flip but don't slip a disc
Let your spine unwind just take a risk

I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn
Tell me party people is that so wrong?
The ship is docking, inter-lockin
And up-rockin electro-shocking

We're getting down computer action
Do the robotic satisfaction
All of y'all get off the wall
Have a ball and get involved with

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Flame on, I'm gone
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon
Came out rapping when I was born
Mom said rock it till the break of dawn

Puttin bodies in motion cause I got the notion
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion
The sound of the music makin' you insane
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame

Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf Du Pap
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap
We need body rockin' not perfection
Let me get some action from the back section

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Mike D with the master plan
Ooh my my and thank you ma'am
And when I grab the mic you scream Ooh god damn
The creme de la creme is who I am

MCA where have you been?
Packed like sardines in the tin
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim

Ad Rock light up the place
And if you pull my card you pull the ace
And if you ask me turn up the bass
And if you play Defender, I could be your hyper space

Body movin', body movin',
A1 sound, never sound so soothing
Body movin', body movin',
We be getting down and you know we're crush groovin'

Well, now, don't you tell me to smile
You stick around I'll make it worth your while
Like numbers beyond what you can dial
Maybe it's because were so versatile

Style, profile I said
It always brings me back when I hear Wu child
From the Hudson river out to the Nile
I run the Marathon to the very last mile

Well, if you battle me I feel revile
People always sayin' my style is wild
You've got gaul, you've got guile
If you step to me I'm going to rap full file

If you wanna battle you're in denial
Comin' from Uranus to check my style
Go ahead with my rhymes I'll trial
Cast you off into exile

Intergalactic, planetary, planetary, planetary, planetary Intergalactic

Jazz and Awol, that's our team
Step inside the party, disrupt the whole scene
When it comes to beats, well, I'm a fiend
I'd like my sugar with coffee and cream

Well, I gotta keep it going keep it going full steam
To sweet to be sour to nice to be mean
With the tough guy style I'm not too keen
Trying to change the world, I'm going to plot and scheme

Mario C likes to keep it clean
Goin' to shine like a sunbeam
Keep on rappin, 'coz that's my dream
Thank Mo D for sticking to the beats

Now when it comes to envy y'all is green
Jealous of the rhyme and the ryhme routine

Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
Your rhymes are spread just like a pox
'Coz the music is loud like an electric shock

I am known to do the wop
Also known for the Flintstone Flop
Tammy D gets biz on the crops
Beastie Boys known to let the beat, mmm, drop

Now when I wrote graffiti my name was Slop
If I rap soup my beats is stock
Step from the table when I start to chop
I'm the lumberjack D.J Ad Rock

If you try to knock me you'll get mopped

Your knees start shakin' and your fingers pop

Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know it's on
I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn
Can't rock the house without the party people
'Cause when we're gettin' down we are all equal

There's no better or worse between you and me
But I rock the mic so viciously

I like pins and needles and words that sting
At the blink of an eye I will do my thing
It's like a needle in the cartridge when the record spins
I like a diggin' down deep in the record bins

When everybody gettin' down make no mistake
Nothing sounds quite like an 8 0 8

Money makin' money money makin'

Super disco disco breakin'

Money makin' money money makin'

Super disco disco breakin'

Sometimes I like to brag
Sometimes I'm soft spoken
And when I'm in Holland I eat the pannenkoeken
The world is the the spice you bring the sauce
And you can kiss my ass you funky boss

Now that you got what you want, you want more
Well I'll be with the hammer and the nail at your door

Well with these funky beats I be goin' head huntin'
Shouts to my peeps let me know if you feel something
'Cause I can give you all you need
A little beat for the rhythm and some words to read

Let me tell you now that's my favorite shit
And when I got a new rhyme I'll just say

So, money makin' money money makin'

Super disco disco breakin'

Money makin' money money makin'

Super disco disco breakin'

It's Manhattan in the house

Here we go again because it's been awhile
Do me a favor don't touch that dial
I rock from Manhattan to the Miracle Mile
My name's Mike D and I'm the ladies choice
I want to get next to you like Rose Royce
Y'all gather round to hear my golden voice
Cause when its time to rhyme you know I get noice
Cruising like a fan boat on the glade
He'll tweak ass your ass across the cross fade
So watch your back when he takes the stage
Or he'll send you off on a naked rampage

3 MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike what cha got to say


Sweet and sour like a tangerine
Fresh like a box of Krispy Kremes
Kenny Rogers' Gambler is my gambling theme
Mix Master Mike with the scratch routine
Always updated and in the know
You know we break it down going toe to toe
The bass is booming from down below
And Norton is chillin with Mario
Well my name is Adrock I'm a Scorpio
Don't ask me cause I just don't know
I'm known to mop I'm known to glow
But don't get mad cause I got to go

Three MC's and one DJ
We be getting down with no delay
Mix Master Mike what cha got to say

Mix Master cut faster

All top secret and classified
I grab a hold of a mic and let the words glide
It's all hypnotic and sanctified
I never wanna let a bad day slip by
We be getting stupid in your area
Causing all kinds of hysteria
My beats is sick like malaria
But don't worry I'll take care of ya

Something on the windowsill caught her eye and held her still
The cars pass by outside
Nowhere left to hide

Picture this now crystal clear 
Nothing left to hold her here 
And creeping up meanwhile

The cars pass by outside

Now if you check my pulse it beats skull snaps

I gots to do my thing and that's no lie
Well ice is cold and fire is hot
And when it comes to competition we've got them locked
U-N-I-T-E

We'll never know unless we try
So tell me party people what's your zodiac sign

Breakdancers of the world unite

"Oh shit." "Yeah"

I need to break it down every chance I get
So Ssshhh we keep it raw on the set
Automation circulation
Well this is for the people all around the nations
I got books with hooks and it looks like rain
Would someone on the Knicks please drive the lane
Now rhymes are montaquilla on a track by us
I've got to keep my mind clear so I don't bust
If you got bad breath then maybe try scope
And if you wash your ass you best use soap
Now people of the world you realize
We got to get together and harmonize
I feel I'm comin' down with the bugallo flu
"Explain to me really what doctors must.xqzzawzu."

Ravers of the world unite

"Come on now."

We're the scientists of sound
We're mathematically puttin' it down
When lightning strikes best grab a ground
Got to get up to get down

I've got the terminator style with a touch of the tweak
Technique 1200's I'm known to freak
I don't like to fight, I don't carry a piece
I wear permanent press so I'm always creased

Do it like this for the intergalaction
Asana daily so I'm very flexible
I'm a Scorpio so you know I'm very sexual
Shouts to Rach and my brother Matthew
In money makin' it's how we do

A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we here we come like dum ditty dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches

The sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody let's show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower

Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all those people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate

Let's try to negotiate
Oh, let's try to negotiate

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin with the lyrics and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real I keep it really raw

At the risk of sounding crass I would like to mention
That I'm well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose you so and so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you everybody I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MC's are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here we here we come like dum ditty dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches

The sound sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
his primary concern was making a million
being the illest hustler that the world ever seen
he used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
a corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
she put the pipe down, but for every year she was sober
her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
he started hanging out selling bags in the projects
checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
he was fascinated by material objects
but he understood money never bought respect
he built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
but got locked once, and didn't hesitate to squeal
so criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
you see me and niggaz like this have never been equal
I dont project my insecurities at other people
he fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
so he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
a feeble minded young man with infinite potetial
the product of a ghetto breed capatalistic mental
coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
but he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
you probably only did a month for minor offenses
ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
but then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top

there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

So Billy started robbing niggaz, anything he could do
he'd get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
starting fights over little shit, up on the block
stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
working overtime for making money for the crack spot
hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
fulfilling the scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
tired of the block niggaz treating him the same
he wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
but when he tried to step to 'em, niggaz showed him no love
they told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in a club
but only a real thug can stab someone till they die
standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
and they wanted to test him, before business started
suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
so now he had a choice between going back to his life
or making money with made men, up in the cife
his dreams about cars and ice, made him agree

a hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
and so he met them friday night at a quarter to three

Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
you probably only did a month for minor offenses
ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
but then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block

but thats what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
devils used to be gods, angels that fell from the top
there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot

They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
and so they quietly got out the car and followed her
walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
they wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
this is it kid now you got your chance to be raw
so Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
and dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
she struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
they got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
screaming 'shut the fuck up' and 'stop moving around'
the shirt covered her face, but she screamed to the clouds
so Billy stomped on the bitch, until he'd broken her jaw
the dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
they kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
and then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was meant to go first, but each of them took a turn
ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
a broken jaw mumbled for god but they weren't concerned
when they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
one of them niggaz pulled out a brand new twenty-two

they told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
and if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew

he thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
and so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head

I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back

Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
he thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
and he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
but what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
she looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
she cried more painfully than when they were raping her
his whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
his corruption had succesfully changed his fate
and he remembered how his mom used to come home late
working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
he turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
and crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
but only the devil responded, cause god wasn't there
and right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
and so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
they say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
after that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
and listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
and now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
in fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
and every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
he could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
the devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
white, brown, yellow and black, color is not restricted
you have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
and you'll be one of god's children and fall from the top
there's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
so when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
because the dance with the devil might last you forever

Well, I don't understand the phenomenom
We fucking these hoes that look like spallala
Rich boys think that is shitty
But I like fucking crackheads with one tit
And I do it at the drop of a dime
And I get the scabies almost every time
So let's talk about my nutsac
I don't front, Jack, I got bugs on my ballzac

Well I'm Violent J and I ain't no bitch
I'm always quick to tell you when my nuts itch
Cuz bitch if I'm itching when I come home
Drop a brick in a sock swing it on your dome
You didn't think nothing of it, just let me stick it
Probably should of known cuz I thought I heard crickets
In your neden, but I ain't sayin nuttin though
I ain't sayin nuttin till I'm done nuttin, ho
And know I'm like bitch how can this be
Tryin to sleep and my nuts get up and watch TV
Then try to walk to the store and get a 40
How'd these bugs get on me

Somebody asked me how I got scabies
Probably that homeless fat redneck bad lady
That I fucked in the shed
Then the little critters on my dingaling said

Your nuts we want your nuts
We'll itch and scratch and bite your nuts
Your nuts we want your nuts
Please, oh please, fuck dirty butts 

I met this bitch and went up in it
Dropped her off, went to the clinic
Bitch, I got bizugs on my siznac
So tell me what's up with that
Should of said something bout your bug problem
Now I'm gonna have to sock you in your mouth, bitch
Can't keep my motherfucking hands out my drawers
Stick a roach motel up under your balls
Nah, I'd rather stick em in a deep fry
And sizzle those motherfuckers off my wang

So you wanna fuck around, always gotta buck around
Lift up your dingaling nothing but a bug ya found
Now they call you funky nuts cuz you like funky butts
Scratching and biting them, now they call you monkey nuts
But I ain't sayin nothing, cuz you ain't playin nothin
Bring the track back and I get back to the nutsac track

So now I try to rap cuz the bugs is biting
But I ain't going out like a bitch, yo, fuck that
Stick em in a blender and hit the switch
Then I hit the bitch

Met this bum in the back of a dumpster
Fucked her in the rumpster, juggaluga humpster
Had to take a piss, so I pulled out my wang
Then I heard my dingaling sang

Check this out man, I can remember back in school
Back in elementary school, yeah shit used to be cool then
You know what I'm sayin' cause it was all about shootin' dice
And playin' dodgeball and shit you know
But then something happened man everybody grew up
And now ain't nothin' the same like this one punk muthafucka
The same muthafucka I was tradin' G.I. Joe's with and playin' kick ball
Is gonna run up on me and throw a gang sign talkin' about
He's gettin' to fry my head and shit
Well fuck you ya know cause you're still the same fake ass bitch
You always was so don't come around me with that shit cause I know you too well

"Well, Claude, Miss Virginia. A pleasure to see. Oh my, you're all

"Do you know what's under my apron?"
"Well, no, ma'am, I ain't never looked. Well, a cock like I got
I guess."
"No, Claude, it's a nice big cunt."
My name is Shaggy, but some call me Shaggy Balls
Cuz you can see my ball sac hanging out my drawers
I wear short shorts, bitches stop and stare
Later on you see me parting through the cotton hair
I meet a bitch, I always gotta check and ask
How many corn dogs been to the cotton patch
And when I fuck bitches ask what I'm trying to do
My nuts is people, so I'm trying to stuff em in there too
Cotton Candy, it wasn't made for the mouth
You don't believe me, then take a look and then south
Rotten candy, is what you'll find without a doubt
I stick my wang in the cotton hole and then I'm out
Jump Steady, Rude Boy, and Nate the Mack
They huntin cotton and Shaggy Shagg know where it's at
So don't be stingy, there's more than one wicked clown
And, bitch, you got enough cotton here to go around
Now some bitches wanna go and shave the cotton off
Straight to the candy, I'm with it, I won't get lost
That's why I bring the clippers with me, they coming in handy
When you fuck around with the cotton candy
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey, cotton candy, yeah, hey hey
Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in your mouth, she told me
My name is J, the kiddies call me jitty pants
Cuz I can play the flute and make my dick start to dance
Like a snake, I make it shake, rattle and roll
And this year, my ball's made it to the Cotton Bowl
Unlike Shaggy, he's scared of the cotton pie
I ate so much cotton candy I got pink eye
I can remember the first time I had a taste
She pulled her panties down and stuffed her cotton in my face
I said, "your daddy's home", she said "so fucking what?"
I tried to take my dingaling and stick it in her butt
I tried to push it in, I couldn't turn it out
She said "Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in your mouth"
Oh shit, so what was I to do
Run like a bitch, or have the cotton stew
I thought for a second, then I said what the fuck
I ate so much cotton that my tongue came out her butt
Eewwww, bitch, I'll have another bowl
My boys had to come and get me cuz I lost control
On the way home, I had a new attitude
I'm like "hey, let's go eat some more pussy, dude"
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey, cotton candy, yeah, hey hey
Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in your mouth, she told me
"Marge, you know where the money is. You get it and hold it for
Miss Vicki while I kiss her pussy."
"Sure, Claude, honey."
"Okay Claude, now before you kiss my pussy. Lick the insides of
my thighs. Here and here. Yes, it helps get pussy warm."
"Yes, ma'am"
"That's it, Claude, nice and slow. Oh, that's nice, Claude baby."
Heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeey, cotton candy, yeah, hey hey
Cotton Candy don't get wet until it's in your mouth, she told me
"Nice and slow. Oh, that's nice, Claude baby. Oh God. Oh. Lick the
hairs of my pussy. Ohh-oh that's nice Clause. Keep licking. Huh uh
keep licking. Oh my pussy, come on, Claude."
"Go ahead and suck you bastard.
Oh lick it, oh! fuck! lick more
Suck it, suck it, suck motherfucker, suck!"

Ladies and gentlemen

The most horrifying, terrifying, mystifying ride
Available to the dead
Gather round my dead friends
And witness the bizarre, horrid dictales
As told to you by your favorite
Serial clown slaughterers the ICP
So who will be brave enough to step into this ride?
Just follow the trail of blood into the red tent
There your host, Willaby Rags, will strap you in
And you shall experience, the wheel!
So gather and watch, look and learn
The ways of the Terror Wheel
Oh look, there goes one now
He's walking in, good luck fella
There he goes, they're locking him into the cage
Greetings, I'm Willaby Rags
Prepare for your first stop, the Dead Body Man!
Ahahaha!

Dead bodies, dead bodies all over the street
Fifty-five, sixty-five bodies atleast
I hang with the stiffs till the break of dawn
I'm always finding bodies when I'm mowing the lawn
Drag 'em in the house, throw 'em in the oven
Wicked clown lovin that dead body grubbin
Tastes like chicken finger lickin deep fried
I ate a dead body, but don't tell, I lied
I just ate my first dead body last week
Still got the finger nail caught in my teeth
Before you start yelling and cursin my name
Remember something's wrong with my brain, insane
Second I was born, doctor threw me against the wall
Kicked open the doors and he whipped me down the hall
I'm sliding and I'm bouncing off shit like a hockey puck
And my mother's like "What the fuck?!"
He said I was born of an alien race
Born with a hatchet and a juggalo face
But I'm not a martian, you wouldn't understand
I'm just a dead body man
We got bodies, dead bodies
We got fat ones, skinny ones
Males, females, hermaphrodites
We got somebodies, we got nobodies
Bodies, bodies, bodies, whoo!


Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man

Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man 
Call me the dead body man, call me the dead body man

Dead bodies, dead bodies in the back of my van
All the little kiddies love the dead body man
I drive through my neighborhood ringing my bell
Some people run cause they don't like the smell
Others line up just as quick as they can
To try and catch a glimpse of the dead body man
It's all good, if you can stand the funk, but uh
Just don't look in the trunk
I drive down Central kickin the bass
Chillin with my freaks and I'm pickin her face
Maggots and bugs like to crawl on her head
Cause my bitch is dead, I'd rather that instead
Of a hoe you can't trust, always diggin a nut
A dead body bitch learn to keep her mouth shut
Riding in the back is my dead body crew
Only they can never think of nothing to do
If you think I'm sick take a look at yourself
You got dead deer heads up on your shelf
On your key chain is a little baby rabbit's hand
I'm just the dead body man
We also collect dead bodies
So, if you know any dead people
Or you yourself are planning on dying soon
We'll be happy to come to your house, and pay cash for it
We appreciate good healthy stiffs for our dinner
Woohoo!

Ya know what I'm saying
All you bitches, man
Come over to my house
And I'ma take ya upstairs
And I'ma stick you with my wang
Ya know what I'm saying?
I stuck her with my wang
She hit me in the balls
I grabbed her by her neck
And I bounced her off the walls
She said it was an accident and then apologized
But I still took my elbow and blackened both her eyes
I stuck her with my wang
Bitchy bitchy hoe
I'd like to stick a Faygo bottle in her neden hole
I twist ya and turn ya, just to shake it up
Pop off the lid now it's shooting out her butt
I stuck her with my wang
She grabbed by me nuts
She told me that she loved me then commenced on the sucking
I tried to hold it back, but I nutted in her ear
When it dried up, the bitch couldn't hear


I stuck her with my wang 
I stuck her with my wang 

I stuck her with my wang
I'm ringing dingaling
After I hit it, my boys will do the same
Bitches come in flocks when the carnivals in town
Suckin on my nuts, trying to be down
I stuck her with my wang
The freaky little slut
She wanted me to stick my finger in and out her butt
I asked the bitch why, she gave no reply
I went psycholistic and I stuck it in her eye
I stuck her with my wang
I hit it slow motion
I had the Ringmaster brew me up a love potion
I put it on her neden, I know this sounds insane
Her coochie started whistling and singing out my name
Shaggy, Shaggy, Shaggy, stick me with your wang!



I stuck her with my wang
I hit it chicken style
I hit up in Meijer's in the home improvement aisle
She called me Bob Vila when I stuck it in the place
I tied her legs behind her head and kicked her in the face
I stuck her with my wang
I took some Elmer's glue
I slapped it on her titties and I stuck her to the roof
And when I came back, I opened up the door
Her titties were so long they was draggin on the floor
I stuck her with my wang
A little two on one
I told her call a friend over, we can have some fun
I heard her knock knock, I'm finna get some stank
I opened up the door
Hi, I'm Frank
I kicked him in his ass 
I kicked him in his ass 
I stuck her with my wang 
I kicked him in his ass 
I stuck her with my wang

Laying in my bed, I think of many horror tales.
Yet I better move, my bed is made of nails.
I try to roll off, my skin slowly tears away.
My flesh is stuck to the bed as I begin my day.
Walking out the house this morning, the sky is red.
The streets are crowded with the bodies of the living dead.
They're tryin' a die, they're jumping off a roof tops.
They only scream in pain as their body flops.
I rather stay inside my home and only pray to die.
But my house has been on fire since like '85.
I can only stand a night of the fatal smoke.
But see you never die, you only burn and choke.
And so I leave out the house, and walk the land.
Wild pigs run and feed off the dying men.
And look around you, there's bodies hanging from the trees,
But they're not dying, they're only crying, "Please!"
I hear the thunder in the sky so I run and hide.
The Deli Raymay soon come down, you've got to get inside.
The lunatics see the lightning, they're screaming, "Yes!"
It's raining blood, the streets are a bloody mess.
About once or twice a week, though, with thunderstorms.
That's when giant, heavy, red and black clouds form.
It's raining blood, kidneys, and livers from the sky.
Prepare, cuz when you die, you're coming to the Killing Fields.

:

"What shall they be? What shall they be? When that fine moment comes."

"When the curtains are drawn, the windows are shut, doors closed, and
you've
written
what you've written, you've said it, that's it!" (coming to the killing
fields)

"What will they all be? What about it mister, when you've had you're last
beer?


You've laughed at you're family and laughed at you're little wife. She
begs you
not to go
out to that bar."


As I feed off a dead pig, I'm thinking back.
To when I had a heartbeat, and how I would act.
I would steal from the poor. I'd laugh at the sick.
But in the killing fields, you'd get your fucking neck ripped!
So as I walk along I meet a lot of strange folks.
Some people with no eyes, and gashed open throats.
And if they notice your eyeballs are working well,
The try ta dig them out your skull, and go for self.
Now in the summertime, it's like a whole other realm.
Water becomes fire, and oceans overwhelm.
To walk outside, the heat will surely cook your brains
Try to run across the street, your hair will burst ta flames.
Victims in a panic run from the heat and light,
Underneath the city, into the sewer pipes.
Until the fire's gone this becomes your new land.
But, there's no food so you feed off the other men.
And now it's been seven months, I'm barely fed.
I chase a baby billy goat with a human's head.
It's steady screamin' "Lemme be, lemme be!"
But while I chase it there's another demon chasin' me.
All of time moves backwards, I'm growing old.
And still the clouds are burning fire, and so I'm told
That there's a lot of living souls such as the rich,
That choose to live like a bitch.
See you in the killing fields!

:

"Youve had your big time in lust, sin, and filth!"

"What is it going to be when you realize the time is up? You've crossed
the
finish line!
Going in the wrong direction." 

"What shall they all be? What about it gentlemen? When you've spent your
life
in a few
years' time?"

"Your a burned up shell at 25 years of age. What shall they all be?" What
about it?


You can go to hell hell hell hell hell
"What shall they all be?"


Come, come on down, down.
Come, come on down, down.  (w/
echo)
Come, come on down, down.
Come, come on down, down.

Maggots can't fuck with the Shaggy
Cuz I got a crew, bitch
A crew like you ain't never even known
Carnival freaks from the ghetto zone
All waiting for the day to put you in your place
I'll have the fat bearded lady sitting on your face
Bitch boy bitchy you might get hurt
Dead Carnival clowns putting in w-w-w-work
You think your the shit cuz you think you got the upper hand
But why don't you come and meet my boy, the strong man
And he'll grab you by the head and squeeze until it pops
And shake your motherfucking neck until your head flops
Cuz I'm running with the beyond, you motherfucks
I'll make a voodoo doll of ya, and flick your nuts
See I was born to cause a killer carny ruckus
I came out the neden stabbing and choking motherfuckers
I leave a screw driver sticking half way out your dome
The worst part about is, I'm not alone

Violent J 

Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight
J-J-J-Jimmy cracked corn but they don't care
They bust ya in your motherfucking head with a chair


I'm a nerd, and all the bitches call me a nerdy geek
And they would love to stick their thumbtacks on my seat
And they would throw their split balls at the class freak
And everyone of them bitches died in there sleep!
Cuz I fuck around with books and the severed barn
Crystal balls, black magic and jokers cards
And that night just when I'm feelin lonely
The clowns come to my bed and juggle for me
So don't fuck with the Shaggs cuz I cast spells
And don't come crying to me when your tongue swells
I'm hanging with freak shows, like Crab Boy, Snake Boy
Flipper and Scab Boy
And a man who can eat his own fucking face
And then shit it out and screw it back into place
If you don't think so you can suck my bone
Cuz I tried telling ya man, I'm not alone

Well I like to hang with Tall Jess and Jump Steady
Nate The Mack, Violent J and Uncle Freddy
Chucky Mutha Fucky and Scott got my respect
But I really like to hang with old rubber neck
A freak show from the circus that you don't know
And I fucked the Lion Lady in the neden hole
And sometime she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts
And it feels so good!
So tell your boys that they all a bunch of chump suckers
I walk around your neighborhood chokin motherfuckers
I used to be a fool but now the joker's got juice
Shit changed when I started hanging out with Zeus
And if you take me out you know I'm coming back again
With my homeboys Jack and the Cannon Man He come flying
Out the barrel doing Mach 9
With his fist coming straight for your spine
Never fuck with the Shaggs cuz it's always tickin
I throw a curse and turn your ass into a chicken
So when you see me by my lonely in the ghetto zone
Motherfucker better realize, I'm not alone


Who's that 
Who's there?
No, stop it!
Ahh, I can't stand it
Ahh, go away
Leave me alone
No, no, ahhhhh!

Mr. Piser, I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and brain has gone ecstatic


Not another day of all the suffering and pain I was just a little boy ever so naive
Amy was my best friend, I never want to hurt her
I never wanna ever wanna think about her murder
On the playground, I chase her down the slide
I chase her cross the monkey bars and she would run and hide
Jinglin and tumbling, I pushed her off the sled
Amy coincidently hit her head
Dumbling inside my brain, down came the wade
Amy isn't answering, who would get the blame?
Amy isn't laughing, Amy isn't crying
Amy isn't really breathing, god I think she's dying
Suddenly, the air is cold I must get her inside
Even though she died, Amy has to hide
Nobody must ever know that I made Amy sick
Lock her up forever in the attic


Maybe it is best to die, thinking did she really die
I'm thinking if it's really true then how come I am telling you
And if I really meant to do it, should I be a victim to
Should I walk the terror stairs, and savior all my
terror fears, no


Mr. Piser, I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone ecstatic


Every day I suffer but eleven years have passed
How long will this keep and the nightmares last
Sitting in my living room, another strange feeling
I think I'm hearing tiny footsteps on the ceiling
Looking in my mirror, the image isn't clear
I feel as if a little girl is standing at my rear And
then I awake at the blink of an eye
Voices from the attic yellin, "why?"
What if Amy wasn't dead living in the box
Banging on the walls, rattling the locks
Feeding on the roaches, rodents, and filth
And when there's nothing left, she feeds off herself
Why do I think in Amy of this way?
She was once a lovely girl running out to play
Maybe it's all a dream insane fanatic
Maybe there's no Amy in the attic after all


Maybe it is best to die, thinking did she really die
I'm thinking if it's really true then how come I am telling you
And if I really meant to do it, should I be a victim to
Should I walk the terror stairs, and savior all my
terror fears, no


Mr. Piser, I think you should come up here
Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone ecstatic


Maybe it is best to die, thinking did she really die
I'm thinking if it's really true then how come I am telling you
And if I really meant to do it, should I be a victim to
Should I walk the terror stairs, and savior all my
terror fears, no


Amy isn't dead...


Amy's in the attic and my brain has gone ecstatic
Barrels to my nugget semi glock automatic
Should I pull the trigger, would this break the chains
That keeps Amy locked in my brain
No, I must be starting to pray that I won't
I pray it's just a figment, to see this carry on too long
Amy isn't dead, I never knew an Amy
I was just a boy, how can you blame me?
Maybe that's okay, but she's tapping at the walls
I see a darling little girl is floating down the hall
Slowly coming toward me, her arms are spreading wide
Opens up her mouth to show the maggots inside
Crying, whining, rotting is the feeling
Tiny drips of blood crowning from the ceiling
Landing on my head, I'm psycho-sick I've finally had it
Amy, know I'm coming to the attic!


Maybe it is best to die, thinking did she really die
I'm thinking if it's really true then how come I am telling you
And if I really meant to do it, should I be a victim to
Should I walk the terror stairs, and savior all my terror fears, yes


Mr. Piser, I think you should come up here

Should I walk the terror stairs, and savior all my terror fears, no

"This is your host Willaby Rags once again
I hope you enjoyed your ride on the Terror Wheel
But it isn't over just yet we have one more for you
We have a phone number for you to call to hear the name
Of the third Joker's Card
The area code is one three one three
And for the rest of it listen to the rhymes and match the numbers
That go with them... Ha, ha, hah"

Three one three
Call one three one three 

Unlock the door and what's in store
Will belittle you forever more
The number is...

I've come to late and never saw the great
All I saw is hate
So the number is...

Everywhere I go there's a Juggalo
And he's my hero
The number is...

The Juggalos key will forever be
Hand in hand with me
The number is...

The essence of time your's was mine
Inside the rhyme you will find
The number...

The moon and the sun, the sword and the gun
Is what I've become
Now the number is...

Now I will go a carnival show
Figure out the rhymes and you'll know
The last number...

Call to reveal the third Joker's Card

Ahhh, make way for the lunatic
I wanna stop, I try but I can't quit
I want necks 2 or 3 maybe more
To squeeze again, and again, and squeeze some more
I came up, walkin down Boulavard
Then this girl, she makes my nutsack hard
I don't know, what about my mental state
They might find a bitch dead, theres nothin else that I hate less
Hey man jump in, toots, hungary? Well I got some, nuts
Oh shit, she's runnin on my wang
Then somethin goes, snap, bang
Eh bitch, ha ha, die
Her neck long, skinny like a french frie
So I twist, turn, tangle then I strangle
Cuz I'm the Southwest Strangla

I want necks, long, tall, skinny
Any ol' necks at all, if any Jenny, Linny, Sidney, Sue
I want, necks, so I go to the zoo
I choke a Pelican, I did it right
I choke an Ostrich, long ass neck
But I'd rather be killen at the prom
I pick up my date, I get to meet her mom
Hello Miss I hurry home quick
All I wanna do is choke her neck a bit
Worry not, I bring the corpse back
I just wanna hear a neck bone snap
Why me? Hey I'm sweatin Comosion, dillusion, confusion, psycho
All I wanna do is kiss you good-bye
Before I mangle ya
Cuz I'm the Southwest Strangla

I got the southside scared, cuz I'm weird
I was a freak in the 2nd grade I had a beard
I sit alone in the back of the art class
And draw necks with a big red dash
I never thought I'd be a lunatic
A descrase, a droped out mental case
I quit school, but I never left the hall
I grab kids and drag 'em in between a wall
Hear 'em scream, echo through the gym class
You hear me chokin bitches up in the wind shaft
They call me, The Ghost of the Bad Lands
But I'm really just a killa, with big hands
Allow me to squeeze your neck dear
Until your brains pop dead out your fucken ear
Burry them in my back yard With a twisted spine broken bones

...Cuz I'm the Strangla

"Why must my visions be so clear? The truth? The truth, I've got work to do."

I got shot with a buck shot, shot me down
But you know you can't paint a frown on a clown
Sewer gutter blood runs through my system
Death stopped by but I must have just missed him
Am I in a Southwest street gang?
Do I bang?
Do I slang?
Do I let my muthafucking nuts hang?
But do you care?
I got stabbed in the eye and you wadn't nowhere
And what about the time I got fucked?
When I got shot in the throat... fucking sucked
But your news wasn't on it
You could give a fuck less
Never the less
Unless
Something happened in your suburb
I'ma cut your daddy's neck, you little fucking nerd
I don't give a fuck where you're from boy
So don't tell me cause I don't... give a fuck
It's all about what's going on in your head
Do or don't you care about the seventeen dead?
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Do or don't you care about the seventeen dead?
Seventeen dead, anybody yo
Seventeen dead, anybody yo
Seventeen dead, anybody yo
You could give a fuck less about the seventeen dead...
"The seventeenth boyfriend lost his erection..."

I woke up next to a dead body
Roll it out the way and jump out of bed
Strap on my kicks and step out my room
Cause somehow, there's another stiff in the bathroom
Dead fucks all over the grass
I'ma kick somebody in they dead ass
Quick to make a left on Jefferson
And I noticed there's another stiff riding shotgun
Am I just seeing things? No
Is your mother a soggy hoe?
I like to drink Faygo, out in front of Scotty's
But then one by one, my homeboys turned into dead bodies
But I'm straight with that
Just don't be leaving your guts in my car and shit
"Yo, wait a minute, wait, get your head on straight"
I drop seventeen tears from eyes every fucking day
I gotta wonder if they do
Should I burn the rebel flag?
Or the red, white, and blue too?
I can't do much, but they can
But those motherfuckers got a death wish, man
I'm gonna swim in they blood shed
Just to justify... the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Do or don't you care about the seventeen dead?
Seventeen dead, anybody yo
Seventeen dead, anybody yo
Seventeen dead, anybody yo
You could give a fuck less about the seventeen dead...
"The seventeenth boyfriend lost his erection..."

Yeah, dead bodies man.
They ain't so bad.
I mean they're all over the neighborhood and shit you know?
But they don't be fucking with you.
They just lay there dead and shit.
I mean they tasted kinda straight, with a little mustard, man.
Yeah..."

Seventeen dead bodies hanging from a telephone wire
All seventeen on fire
Lightening up the sky with the smell of death
Rich, bigot, fucker, take a deep breath
Looking at you makes me go batty
Muthafucka, don't be nothing like your daddy
Cause he's nothing but a redneck hoe
Him and his kind created this ghetto
They can't deal with they own creation
Move out further, suburb vacation
But it don't work like that
Knock at your door and it's me running slug bat
I'm a stick it to your fucking nugget
About seventeen times and you're gonna love it
Motherfucker, drive down my street
And stare at the folks who can't make end's meet
You don't know now, but that's the plan
Most people in Hell were rich when they died, man
Take that to your golden bed
Cause I'ma cut ya ass up... for the seventeen dead

Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
I'ma cut your ass up man for the seventeen dead
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
I'ma chop your ass up man for the seventeen dead
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
I'll chop you, I'll slice you seventeen dead
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo
Seventeen dead, anybody, yo...

Yeah... yeah... yeah...
Well, ya know Violent J's kinda wicked
If there's a booger in my nose, I'ma pick it
And flick it in your eye like you ain't jack
And stomp my boots on your nut sac
Well, I'm Shaggy and I'm in the house
Ya don't think so, I'll put a brick in your mouth
Can't nobody flex on the nutty clown
I got boys downriver, straight Inktown

Well, ya know I'm coming straight from the trailer park
That's me out front working on the Skylark
I'm waiting on a check, I don't cut the grass
And my woman's got babies falling all out her ass

I'll be running with the carnival until I'm eighty
Cause tonight I'm going out with the fat lady
I strip the bitch down to the nitty gritty
But I ain't saying shit about her one titty

But I'm the type that like to light another joint, like Cypress Hill
I steal doobies, spit loogies when I puff on it
I got some bucks on it, but it ain't enough on it
Go get the S, the T, I D-E-S
Nevertheless, I'm hella fresh, rollin' joints like a cigarette
So pass it 'cross the table like ping pong
I'm gone, beatin' my chest like King Kong
It's on, wrap my lips around the forty
And when it comes to getting another stogie
Fools all kick in like Shinobi
No, he ain't my homie to begin with
It's too many heads to be popping to let my friend hit it, bit
Unless you pull out the fat, crispy
Five-dollar bill, on the real, before it's history
‘Cause fools be having them vacuum lungs
And if you let 'em hit it for free
You hella dumb-da-dumb-dumb
I come to school with the Taylor on my earlobe
Avoiding all the thick teasers, skeezers, and weirdos
That be blowing off the land, like, where the bomb at?
Give me two bucks, you take a puff
And pass my bomb back
Suck up that dank like a Slurpee
The serious bomb will make a niggy go delirious, like Eddie Murphy
I got more growing pains than Maggie
‘Cause homies nag me 
To take the dank out of the baggie

I got five on it 
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messing with that Indo weed
I got five on it 
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

I take sacks to the face whenever I can
Don't need no crutch, I'm so keyed up
'Til the joint be burning my hand
Next time I roll it in a hampa
To burn slow, so the ashes won't be burning up my hand, bruh
Hoochies can hit, but they know they got to pitch in
Then I roll a joint that's longer than your extension 
‘Cause I'll be damned if you get high off me for free
Hell no! You better bring your own spliff, chief
What's up? Don't babysit that, better pass the joint
Stop hitting, ‘cause you know you got asthma
Crack a 40 open, homie, and guzzle it
‘Cause I know the weed in my system is getting lonely
I gotta take a whiz test to my P. O
I know I failed, ‘cause I done smoked major weed, bro
And every time we with Chris, that fool rollin' up a fatty
But the Tanqueray straight had me

I got five on it
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messing with that Indo weed
I got five on it
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

Hey, make this right, mane, stop at the light, mane
My yester-night thing got me hung off the night train
You fade, I fade, so let's head to the East
Hit the stroll to 9-0, so we can roll big hashish
I wish I could fade the eighth, but I'm low budget
Still rollin' a two-door Cutlass, same old bucket
Foggy windows, soggy Indo
I'm in the 'land getting smoked with my kinfolk


Been smoked, Yuk'll spray ya, lay you down
Up in the O-A-K, the Town
Homies don't play around, we down to blaze a pound
Then ease up, speed up through the E-S-O
Drink the V-S-O-P up, with a lemon squeeze up
And everybody's rolled up, I'm the roller
That's quick to fold a blunt out of a bunch of sticky doja
Hold up, suck up my weed is all you do
Kick in feed, ‘cause where I be we needs half, like Umfufu

I got five on it
Grab your 40, let's get keyed
I got five on it
Messing with that Indo weed
I got five on it
It's got me stuck, and I'm tore back
I got five on it
Partner, let's go half on a sack

The truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off 

Bad bitches wanna be my bae
 Hunt me down like the C.I.A
 Side of my car, tryna see my face
 Want me to beat it like the T.I. case
Oh  and if it's heated I'ma feed my face
 And best believe, it's gon' be outrageous
 Hatin' niggas can't believe my race
 Niggas hit you with the Eli face, oh...

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Scrunchin' their eyes with your name in their mouth and
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

 You keep askin' me where I'm from
 About the borders and, "Did I run?"
 Keep askin' how I feel 'bout guns
There's a light  and dark army, which side you choose?
Oh  If not now then when?
 And if not me then who?
 Don't drink the Kool-Aid, my friends
 I tried to tell y'all about this dude

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'
Hate supplements are found right in their couches
Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'

 Shout out to them people
People  p-p-p-people, people...
 Mad ethnic right now

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the
 Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me, Rih, in the new La Ferrar'

And the truck behind me got arms
Yeah, longer than LeBron
Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch
But it's runnin' from veneers and it's runnin' from the fronts
But everyday, hey, wasn't lemonade
I was afraid, once a nigga graduate
Would I be okay?
So I prayed and I prayed
It's Rihanna, nigga
My constellation in space
Warp speed, Doctor Spock couldn't chase

Nigga, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

Bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face
Bath, bath salt, bitin' speakers in the face

I get it how I live it
I live it how I get
Count the mothafuckin' digits
I pull up with a lemon
Not 'cause she ain't livin'
It's just your eyes get acidic
And this here ain't a scrimmage
Mothafucka, we ain't finished
I told you we won't stop
A nigga 'bouta business
Like yours, but you rent it
Wave hello to the top
Nigga the Veyron glide
Tell the paparazzi get the lens right
Got the window down, top, blowin' la
Got the hazards on, only doin' five
You can catch me

Bouncin' around, bouncin' around, bouncin'...

You can catch me...
Wait-wait a minute
Wait-wait a minute
Wait-wait a minute
Wait, wait a minute
Wait-wait a minute
Wait-wait a minute
Wait-wait a minute

Yo, this Virginia
Straight from the country, right there wit my kinfolk
Golds and my mouth and they put 26's on Benzo's
Dirt roads, back wood
They got weed but I've been dope
Ratchet, n-gga we act hood
But I'm getting money with these white folk
Sippin and I'm faded, super medicated
Said she wanna check the pole
I said Okay Sarah Palin, so I lay down and lay in
A n-gga gon' be faded, sll the way to the AM

More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt b-ch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn b-tch I do it

And this the live we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'mma do this till I die
And I ain't talking sh-t just cause I'm, just cause I'm...


Oh God, oh God

Ok, wow, bow
Look at me now, chief like a indian
Talkin in clouds, I'm high as a b-tch
I'm talking to clouds
Off tree every night like I roam with the owls
I super soak that ho, show 'em no love just throw em a towel
Still rocking Louis Vuitton condom, cause I'm so f-ck-ng in style, wow
New crib, crash that
Drove here, cab back
Now knock that pussy out, yeah that's just a little cat nap
Hold up, hold up woah
Don't be smoking my sh-t, I be smoking that fire
And she be smoking my d-ck

More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt b-ch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn b-tch I do it

And this the live we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'mma do this till I die
And I ain't talking sh-t just cause I'm, just cause I'm...


Smoking, choking, always rollin' something
I don't need a key to start my car
Bitch I just push a button and did a show and
Got a half a mill and spent it like it's nothing
Money flowing, never sober
Smoking till I got concussion, no discussion
Man I got a condo and got a big crib
Pounds all over my kitchen is
If I ain't on the road gettin' it
Then I'm in the hood where my niggas live
Did a tour, sold it out, just bought a pound 'bout to finish it
Now all my pasta got shrimp in it
You talk about and I'm living it
Fucking little b-tch

More drink, pour it up
More weed, roll it up
Whoa there ho, you know wassup
Quit hoggin' the blunt b-ch, slow down
Pimps up, hoes down
Ass up, nose down
Damn b-tch I do it

And this the live we chose
Workin' all night
Swear I'm never going broke
And I'mma do this till I die
And I ain't talking sh-t just cause I'm, just cause I'm...

Real n-gga never frontin'
Cause when you got it all
Everybody want somethin'
Middle finger in the air no fist pump
And me, Sean and Wiz got this bitch jumping
Ah! Finally got this b-tch jumping
Got this b-tch jumpin'
Fly... that's me...

Bitch you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurkin', don't die tonight
I just want to dance wit' you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, down the ave and get shaded
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back
In the function, one wrong word, start bustin'
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shootin' in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a creole
T-scrap movin' for the d-lo, what he know?

I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach, Norfside, Long Beach

Hit the corner, make a dollar flip
And split the dollars wit' my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem, playin' no pitches
Never no problem, sprayin' no witnesses
No face, no case, been wit' the shit
Hopped out broad day then emptied clips
Cut class cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know when change gon' come like Obama would say
But they shootin' everyday 'round my mama and them way
So we put a AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem wit' me
How I'm Crippin' where I'm livin', come and follow me
Pistol poppin', Poppy Street

I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Northside, Long Beach, Northside, Long Beach

Nate Dogg still here cause of niggas like me
Police still scared cause of niggas like me
In the hood like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't wit' the business, nigga
Who you murdered? You ain't heard of Coldchain
Best thang, smokin' out the city
Ridin' 'round wit' the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, didn't get your back wet
Now these runnin'-Norfside niggas better factcheck
Frontin' wit' the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from street, they a nigga best yes
'Cept for Little Halftime, Brody bangin' five blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Crippin', Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, pop blocked a corner
Givin' hell 'til it's frozen over, I ain't never ran from nothin'

I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
I ain't never ran from nothin' but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Northside, Long Beach, Northside, Long Beach

Doggytyle, yeah
B.I.G.
To all the ladies in the house
C'mon Big

Another day in the ghetto
One look outside I'm already upset yo
It look about a hundred and two
It's a Saturday and Biggie ain't got nuttin' to do
I'm interrupted by a phone ring
Sometimes I wish I never got the motherfuckin' thing

"Hello, hello?
Can I speak to Biggie?"
Yo who dis?
"Taisha"
Yo call back, I'm busy

Why don't cha hit me on the box a little later
Washed up, got dressed, hits the elevator
Steps out it's the same old scene
Dope fiend, crack fiend, eyewitness news team

I seen a honey with a butt lookin' butter soft
I know she looks much better with them clothes up off
Sittin' all thick, with the ruby red lipstick
That's the one I gotta get with

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Why you wanna get with me?
'Cause you got a big B U T T, see

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Why you wanna get with me?
'Cause you got a big B U T T, see

She said, "If I get witchu, I gotta get witcha whole hood rat crew
Whatcha I think I do? Sling skins for a livin'"
My name ain't November, this ain't Thanksgivin'
You ain't Michael Bivins mack it up flip it, rub it down
Do me baby, I ain't down my name ain't Tupac I don't get around
You hittin' this nigga, how that sound?

First of all you got me mixed up with somebody ya done slept with
Hold up, that's my Neneh Cherry shit, I got somethin' slicker
Let me just sip up on this liquor all I wanna do is smoke
A little chronic slam ya like Onyx, and get ya hooked on
This Biggie Smalls phonics, 102
How to squeeze 22's in them Reebok's shoes?

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha
'Cause you got a big B U T T, see, see

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

Why you wanna get with me?
'Cause you got a big B U T T, see

I said, "Walk me upstairs, 'cause I forgot my Phillies"
She said, "I don't care, just don't be actin' silly"
I knew I had her trapped with my hardcore rap
And it wouldn't take a second 'fore I had her on her back

Foolin' with the bra strap, threw on my Silk CD
'Cause, I wanna get freaky witchou
Lose control on the skins is all I can picture
Now I'm about to hitcha

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Why you wanna get with me?
'Cause you got a big B U T T, see

To all my hoes, respect due Tamika sorry I left you
Michelle I'm glad I met you, you make the head feel special
Now I know it's official that I can touch and tease you
Pull up my pants and diss you and hit the door you came through

Its Cease-a-Lee, A K A Mista Nasty
Germany style, these hoes they blast me
One of the chicken head with sex appeal pass me
That's her hands, ankles, feet they ashy
I like the flashy type, who pass with dyke's
With long hair and they ass be right
I get up on that ass, see what that be like
I fuck a bitch good, if she ask me right

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Can I get witcha, can I get witcha
Why you wanna get with me?
'Cause you got a big B U T T, see

Can I get witcha, can I get witcha

What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake

)
I'm here, I'm watching you 
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through 
This, can be, reality 
Wake, up, my dead face I see 
My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!




On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die
If he start to cry, ask why?
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick
You cursed it, but rehearsed it
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them
I think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch
I know you playin you was rich
Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma.

)
I am here, I'm watching you 
Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through 
This, can be, reality 
Wake, up, my dead face I see 
My dead face I see , my dead face I SEE!




When I see you I'ma. when I see you I'ma.

One: Got into my mind
Shit is smoked up, my sight is blind
C*** back the nine,
Cuz I might not like what I find
Murders I seen, killer fiend
Through the endosheen
Mean burst into flying milloteen
Into see I sit, till I'm rit
I use the gun and slip exhale
Hollow tits

Confused, so I mangle
Demons I had to strangle
Profession hit man,
And so they guns
Multi clips

Got go back and let him pull it

Two: I said I'm rough a real bitch
Nigga, you better back up
With the four-four devid loaded
So motherfuckers slack up
I shit the raps and craps
Give me my snaps
Bitches wanting the claps
Cuz I'm leaving them with fucking gats
I write rhymes, the gay mind
The maintain mind
The rag around my head is for the gang sign
So with the bottom lick the sha body shody
Fear nobody at less catch fucking bodies
On all you bitches, gang-bangers, snitches
I get so fucked up I don't know
Which, which, is which is
Loss need a part of me
Trifling and stifling
Mc's on they ass
Two snakes in the fucking grass, nigga

Interlude: Do you know what time is is?
No friends, J-M

Catch a body ever full moon

Snake relation
Like proper damn nation
Since birth
On this scortched dirt
Badness with the lyricals
Pocket full of miricles
I'm sick, and sick of being tired
Ain't a soul I fear
Too tired to care
And sunwise
To let my tepature rise
Eagle eyes
Don't believe in me
Believe your eyes
Should I cry?
Cuz I wet a nigga then he die
So c*** my lie roll up and get high

She think mets and cot
Because I only get drastic

Bad Boy in the house for the '95
Big shout out to my man Mel Smith, my man Don Cee San in the house
What's up Michelle Ray, what's up boo?

Sick of mama screaming that "Get a job, nigga"
Pressed to the limit, got to rob me a nigga
Simple and plain, my man scooped me in a hooptie
Whispered in his ear "This is what we got to do, G"
Got to bang a nigga and bang a nigga good
So I can cop a Benz and drive the fuck out the hood
Cause baby-mama screaming "Your daughter 12 months"
Can't live life swinging rocks and smoking blunts
Hanging wit the niggas dont pay the bills
And being broke and 30 give a nigga the chills
So what we gotta do is creep and see a sweet vic
Yo, you see that shit? 
Columbian Dominican, yeah whateva
Whoever he was, he had it tucked under the leather
Two keys, 20 G's, nigga please,
Blew his brains out cause witnesses we don't leave

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Cause real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things

After mad blunts and gin we had the plan made
I bought my wifey a crib, I bought the MAFIA a arcade
Mad games: pool tables and candy
A little extra chicken loot be comin in handy
Check it, got on some '95 shit, sold the 5 bought the 6
Delvecc, copped the lex, we was set
We no had work all in the projects
Niggas slingin O's he kept the profit, no one could stop it
We was livin it up
All the sexy young bitches ain't stressin givin it up
Same bitches suckin dick tryin to dress to thrill me
Said the niggaz I killed is out to kill me
Soon as she smoked on that note, I saw trenchcoat
One had a mac spittin, all I saw was gun smoke
The other had a shottie, I was shootin everybody
And I wasn't missing had to get out this position
Niggas still hitting, feel a hot one in my back
Licked six shots, smoked a nigga wit the mac
The nigga wit the shottie still busting, cussing
Mighty goals and puntas
All I'm tryin to do is shoot ya, two shots in the ruger
Booh-yeah, blew his ass out
Then I passed out 

On the road to the riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things

On the road to the riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things

Bad Boy in the house, for the '95 peace
Real niggas, aight

The doctor said I need about three weeks of recovery
But the nurses is lovin me
Sayingthe best part of the day is my half
Feedin me breakfast and givin me a sponge baths
Niggas say I died dead in the streets
Nigga, I'm getting high getting head on the beach
Chillin, sittin on about half a million
With all my niggas, all my guns, all my women
Next two years, I could see about a billion
All for the love of drug dealin
Got no love for the other side, fuck them tricks
Any repurcussion, Junior M.A.F.I.A. spit clips
All the time, Big Poppa kick the raw rhyme
Raw flows, and that's how it goes

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
Hanging wit the niggas is the song I sing
Real niggas do real things

On the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things

Uhh, check it out, uhh
I steps in where the Mo's and the hoes at bay-bee!
Fuck all that pretty shit
Takin it back to the gutter for you motherfuckers
Niggaz know the deal
Niggaz know who the Don is
Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one
Peep game, uhh, what, what

Out of this world like Mars, when I spit these bars
Come fuck with these stars up in luxury cars
We built them radars to stay free from the cops
Crucial choices to make, like A-C or the drop
Are we gonna stop? Shit man never my squad go broke
Your squad arti-choke
Watch your circle vanish like cigar smoke
Ain't no joke, when your ones don't show
Nigga I know, might say 'Been There Done That' like Dre
Through hard work I earn the vault
Promise God to never look back or I turn to salt
Got nice watches nice cars nice bitches and rings
Guess it's safe to say a nigga like me got nice things
Can't relate to motherfuckers, who ain't go no cake
When you all fucked up, and can't get no break
When your fake ass friends, don't help you out when you need it
Be on some real bullshit, politely tell you to beat it
Fuck that, get your own nigga, don't ask me for shit
That's what I did, now they all askin for hits
Nigga it's on for the simple fact I let it be known
We still fly but seperately cause now I, charter my own
Propellers, Goodfellas, leave all them playa haters jealous
Billboard charts should tell us, they can't touch us
Why niggaz bring the ruckus?
Because release day is bigger than Mandela's, motherfuckers

Just some ghetto boys
Living in these ghetto streets -- these ghetto streets
And everyday they gotta fight to stay alive
It's just reality

Yeah, make you a deal, check
These here's the dog years and motherfuckers don't shed
I try to bring you life but motherfuckers want dead
So I travel with the babble, with the chrome, with the lead
Cause when it's on, then it's on, the shots flowin through your head
I been rich I been poor I saved and blown bread
Some say I been here before because of the way I zone
Some said, Jigga zone is like the fallin of Rome
Reoccuring, that he thinks like that cause he's observing
Won't be known until I'm gone and niggaz study my bones
Mentally been many places, but I'm Brooklyn's own
In the physical, onee seems, like a lost body
In fact my thoughts don't differ much from that of God body
But it's the odd shottie, that got cats, likening me
to the mob John Gotti, rap dudes bitin me cause
I got it locked like the late Bob Marley
Pardon me y'all, the great Bob Marley
Solemnly we mourn, all the rappers that's gone
Niggaz that got killed in the field and all the babies born
Know they ain't fully prepared for this New World Order
So I keep it ghetto like sunflower seeds and quarter waters
You walk em through it, you know, talk em through it
Know these beads is more than music whenever I talk to it
Destined for greatness and y'all knew this, when I doubled the pie
Had a shorty and a girdle comin out of B-W-I 
I hated algebra but I loved to multiply
And I told my nigga Big I'd be multi before I die
It's gonna happen whether rappin or clappin have it your way
Cause if that's my dough you're trappin, I'm clappin your way

Damn it feel good to see people up on it
Flipped two keys in two weeks and didn't flaunt it
My brain is haunted, with mean dreams
GS's with BB's on it, supreme schemes, to get Richer
than Richie, quickly, niggaz wanna hit me
If they get me, dress my body in linen by Armani, check it
My lyrical carjack, make your brains splat
High caliber gats is all I fuck with, now peep the rough shit
in my circumfrence, mad bitches, with mad lucci
Bulletproof vestes under they coochie
Spittin my uzi, don't lose me, my trigga niggaz represent
Drivin dirty in J-30's gettin bent
And to my hit hoes, my murder mommies
I be smokin trees in Belize when they find me
While you still killin niggaz with punany, like heiny
and Cyrus up in Cypress fuck you raw you on the floor with the virus
While I just, slang coke, smoke pounds to choke
Got lawyers watchin lawyers so I won't go broke, now check it
Them country niggaz call me Frank White
I'm squirtin off in my loft of course I know my shit's tight
Sunrise open my eyes no surprise
Got my shorty flyin in with keys taped to her thighs
With all the utensils, who hang my china thing
She half black half oriental eighty-six she got me rental
The situation ain't accidental.
What? From a, from a young G's perspective.

And you can't tell I'm high, and you can't tell I'm high
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
And you can't see my eyes, and you can't see my eyes
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
And you can't tell I'm high, and you can't tell I'm high

I got my locs on, welcome to the terrordome
I got them carrots on givin off them pheromones
Women love it when they see me on that motorcycle
Niggas hate it cuz they know I'm makin more than Michael
Been ballin since the word ballin played out
They brought it back to describe me in that maybach
Me and Jeezy Jeezy rollin with our locs on
Smokin somethin good fuckin up the ozone

I got my locs on , I got my locs on 
And you can't see my eyes , and you can't see my eyes 
I got my locs on, I got my locs on
And you can't tell I'm high, and you can't tell I'm high

I got my locs on cuz my eyes are burgundy
And when I get home I don't want the third degree
The verdict be urgently these niggas wanna murder me
They scared of the consequences comin from my defenses
It ain't that expensive have your ass hoppin fences
Lucky motherfucker missed your ass by some inches
Next time understand, what you fuckin' with, it's legendary status
Sittin behind these glasses, nigga

I got my locs on , I got my locs on 
And you can't see my eyes , and you can't see my eyes 
I got my locs on , I got my locs on

There are seven known wonders of the world
You about to witness the eighth, muthafucka

I got King Kong in my trunk, King Kong in my doors
My nuts play ping-pong from the noise
You can hear me from a block away
I'm sittin' next to your ass
And can't hear what you got to say

My shit is loud, my ears is ringin'
My paint job is wet, my chrome is gleamin'
I feel like a vet ballin' on these rookies
An old-school bully, you must have played hooky

I bring it like a bookie, my aggression is depressin'
Don't give a muthafucka time to learn his lesson
A lunatic, y'all know what I represent
The only rapper that wanna fist fight the president

It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back

When I bang this, it's dangerous, nigga's go brainless
So bang this with the four five stainless
And understand that you lookin' at the famous
West-coast rapper who act like a anus

Hollywood, they thought they could tame this
Pit-bull, but I know what the game is
Them fuckers cheat like an NBA ref
If you smoke one, they'll electrocute you to death

I got God on my intellect, Godzilla by the neck
When the nigga come through, who you wanna holler at?
Ghostwriters hit the deck, when ya boi got a tech
Where the fuck is Africa Bambaataa at?

We need to take it back, fuck Viacom
Clear Clear Channel and Radio One
You muthafuckas programmed by the programmers
That's why you gettin' locked up by the dope slammers
Not me

It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back

They music so fluffy, I'm a stay gutter
That shit is kinda popcorn, my shit is so butter
My style never change in twenty two summers
Straight independent and doin' my numbers

This shit don't sell, you know I'm still paid
So sour-puss nigga's can drink lemonade
I'm doin' it for the love, you doin' it because
You need that advancement to spend on them dubs

I don't need a penny but I need many
Don't worry 'bout my money boy, 'cause I got plenty
You muthafucka's worry 'bout flossin' so much
You don't know the fundamentals
You forgot how to brush

These thirty two teeth will give your ass grief
Bite you like a fat burger if you got beef
So whose it gonna be, your favorite MC?
You're scared of the government
They scared of me, now what?

It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas to hold us back
It take a nation of niggas and streets of crack

So young, so angry
Damn that rap music

Ice Cube - Stand Tall
Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause haterism seem like a fucking epidemic
And look at Ice Cube, I ain't no gimmick
I'm straight from the hood, I got to represent it
Now - every day I think about my color
And all the crazy shit we do to one another
I ain't your blood brother, but I'm your cuz brother
Let's take it back to the love and how it was brother
If not, we gon' pull these triggers
Show the world we deserve to be called niggaz
I make a fuck-up, like Don Imus
bow on his knees, and call me yo' highness
You can too, you got the power to
Don't let this motherfuckin system devour you
I won't pretend, or act like I'm knowin you
But check it out I understand what you goin through
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got
I know what y'all motherfuckers thinking, heh heh
Here comes another rapper with a song about hope
All you wanna hear is a song about dope
And how a nigga got mo' money than the Pope
But he'll never tell you when he drop the soap
No ! Ice Cube is here to drop you a note
Cause some of our folk used to hang from ropes
And some of our people used to hang from trees
Now the only thing hangin muh'fucker is DEEZ
So, get your mind right, and I'ma rhyme right
Fuck the limelight, and a blind dyke
I'm the sunlight, too bright to look
When it's all said and done I should write the book
You too cool for school, too old to know?
Get your ass off the grassroots and let 'em grow
I understand, it ain't no love lost
But little kids, it ain't no Santa Claus
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got
I was born in the mud but I came out clean
That's 'til the government tried to intervene
Tried to lock me up when I was only 19
Don't never ever ever let 'em kill your dream
I make shit raw that piss off the law
If you want some fake shit turn this off
If you want some realness I know you can feel this
Maybe we can heal this just like an illness
Black on black, I got'cho back
People don't think that we know how to act
Just because our neighborhood is filled with crack
And the CIA, won't take it back
Never on top, always on the bottom
Never put your trust in Hillary Rodham
Cause I can tell you now it's gon' turn out rotten
Keep on pushin, get 'em 'til we got 'em
But remember, brothers and sisters
You can still, stand, tall
Just be thankful...
For what you got
Raise your hand if you sick of this bullshit
Heh, in the belly of the evil empire fades

Today was a good day
Know what? Sometimes I just get on my knees
You know what I mean?
And pray to the Man with the master plan
To swoop on down on that mothership
Scoop a nigga up

Lord, have mercy, my people so thirsty
Come, feed 'em, either Jesus or Muhammad
All we get is vomit, come like a comet
Put it in my brain, Lord, put it in my stomach

Only you can run it, I'ma learn from it
Do what I gotta do, try not to plummet
America eats its youth like reptiles
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, let's get this right now

They wanna run us in the ground
Educate yourself before they dumb you down
Get your money boy, the legal way
Beat 'em with they own bullshit if you may

Now rich white men, they got the world fucked up
Why should I give a fuck about a Styrofoam cup?
Environmental scene, I'll keep it clean
But if I go green, you know what I mean, bitch

Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people
Take me away
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people

Ice Cube for President
Let's just do it for the hell of it
See how I'd run the government, make money irrelevant
I might tell a chick, it's illegal to be celibate

Secret Service don't know where the hell I went
Sorry y'all, I had to fuck a super delegate
Dream ticket, Ice Cube and Obama
American dream, Ice Cube and yo' mama

The Terminator, are you Sarakana?
Arnold Schwarzenegger, can kill who he wanna
In California, they strap you to a gurney
And murder yo' ass in front of your attorney

Do you really wanna take this journey?
Ain't scared of none of y'all motherfuckers like Bernie
Mac step back, step back, I got the Mac-11
Unlike Obama, I'ma have to back my reverend

Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people
Take me away
Take me away from these people
Take me away from these people

Now the Lord is my shepherd, my flow is respected
Worldwide, from the West I got to rep it
So please check it, 'cause my style is infected
With the virus, Ice Cube's the Osiris

I bail through, they wanna put me up in Bellevue
'Cause my point of view is not red, white and blue
It's black and blue residue
I know what crack can do to a whole fuckin' avenue

Speak on it and they'll get mad at you
You think I do this bullshit for your gratitude?
I'm a Nigga With a Attitude
I'ma do what I gotta do just to change my latitude

Pimp the system, rollin' with my diamonds glistenin'
And niggaz listenin' from your local prison
I'm a prism, your only vision is a rainbow
In the sky when I spit the ism, come on

Take me away from these people
Take me away
Take me away from these people
Take me away

Take me away from these people
Take me away
Take me away from these people

If I can picture that, I bring a picture back

They say gangsta, gangsta, tell me how you do it
How you get through it and them other niggas blew it

Chase it like a cheetah, choke it out and subdue it

So self educate, nigga don't hate
'Cause the game I got is Fuck with Cube, I'm better than Youtube
Fuck with them dudes, them nigga's is new school

The game don't change, just the playa's
The rhymes don't change, just the fuckin' rhyme sayers
They make it up as they go along

Or change your whole life in a major way
The shit they say might catch you a case

Straight hell on earth for come about the abyss

If there's another hustle out there, I'ma crack it
Fuck the new dance, I'ma learn how to eat
Get my mind right, stay up out these fuckin' streets

They keep callin' me, they keep callin'
All the lil' homies keep fallin'
In 'em sand traps, nigga's can't figure out
In the fast lane, boy put the bridges out

Make my blood boil, get ya life spoil
Get you in the system, get you in the soil
And you funeral sponsored by Unical
Saw your UVN nigga digital

Keep your head up, fuck what they said
'Cause you can do it and the man will get you through it

I know it's fucked up how they do us
Pretend they really care but then they Jerry Lewis
Take that money that was allocated to us
Put us in some fucked up trailers then sue us

Watchin' Katrina is worser than Argentina
See New Orleans gettin' bitch slapped by FEMA
Louisiana got racist ass politics
Free the genesigs, nigga free the genesigs

Your honor, Osama, Obama
Even your mama ain't fuckin' with my karmas
They want us to quit, forget
And not give a shit about these sick ass politics

A lunatic is in the White House
Make me wanna go do a lick right now
But they'll make a nigga bow down
In the penitentiary a billion dollar industry

To all my people goin' through it on a daily basis
And it seem like the world is full of cold places
Keep your head up, fuck what they said

I do gangsta rap
They wanna blame world problems on gangsta rap
It's our fault, cause motherfuckers is dying in Iraq
It's our fault, cause motherfuckers is starving in Africa
It's gangsta rap fault, that people are poor can't get
enough to fucking eat or live their life
That's rap music fault
It's rap music fault, that we got all this goddamn laws
and restriction and shit we can't do
They blame it all on us
I'm blamin' them for gangsta rap,
because if they didn't create this kind of condition
I wouldn't have shit to rap about

You know what I mean?

A'right, a'right, everybody back up, star status comin' through
The man is in the building
Don't touch him, don't look at him, and don't ask to take a picture

I walks in, with that California swagger
With that attitude that it ain't nothin' badder
Now you can call me rapper
Or you can call me mister
Big money trapper, fuckin' with your sister
I'ma do it my way, from here to Zimbabwe
It's too hot today
Fuck what you got to say
Fuck if you mad at me, better go change your battery
Ain't gonn take my sunshine, like I hit the lottery
Ah, he's a show off, a hot head go off
Yeah don't make he mad
He might tear the fucking door off
Take all his cars, and don't try to fall
Cuz one of his people, might cut your fucking toe off
Ice Cube baby, make you take him serious
Everthin' I say, ends with a period
Everthin' I do, ends with you curious
Lookin' for the best rapper
God damn period


Thank God The Gangsta's back And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap

Thank God The Gangsta's back And we don't gotta put up with this brainless rap

All smiles when I'm coming

When I step up in the spot

Nose all in the clouds, Ya'll think I'm too proud
Got to stay above the crowd, How you fuckers like me now
Some of ya'll start to smile
Some of ya'll start to frown
Some of ya'll back up
All niggers start to clap

Yeah
Gangsta

Tell me all my children 'fore I come through
Is the hood in the buildin'? Yes
You won't believe what I'm dealin', this West Coast shit
Oh, what a feelin', ahh

Niggaz think I'm drug dealin'
'Cause I rolled out with no muthafuckin' sealin', none
Is he worth a hundred million?
No need to ask Ice Cube how I'm livin', I'm livin' loc

I still got the recipe
South Central LA is the pedigree
Don't try to tell me what it better be
I have your ass up in physical therapy

I outlaw like a Cherokee
The rap industry tried to bury me
But if I die on a mike of a leraby
I'm so heavy you bitches couldn't carry me

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

I don't accept, no disrespect
Only thing I expect is self check
Just grin and bare it, got an ass whoopin'
That your ass don't wanna inherit

Most rappers are parrots, they say what
They told to say to get a neck fool of carrots
Got your momma embarrassed
How long 'fore they callin' us terrorists, nigga, I'm serious

I keep it gangsta but I keeps a job
'Cause it's hard to sleep when you steal and rob
And ya got to run, here comes the blob
'Cause Uncle Sam is like part of the Mobb

Break your self, he'll take your wealth
Don't get it twisted, you a muthafuckin' elf
And Santa Clause will go for self
All you got is your balls and your health

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

Niggaz brag about what they got
But we don't own a skyscraper, now that's paper
One generation from slums
Happy for these little crumb, you little bums

We saw you pull up but nigga shut up, shut up
You always talk about a fuckin' car or truck
You always talkin' 'bout some fuckin' rims on terrier
That kinda shit will keep an ass inferior

I'm tryna eat tomorrow, not tryin' to hear
'Bout the little bitty shit you ball
Saw your little bitty house on Cribs
Where you fuck your wife and feed your kids

Nigga be quiet, ain't shit private
Everythin' for sale, you can buy it
All this self snitchin', all this self tellin'
Muthafuckas goin' back to the watermelon

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

Get money, spend money, no money
Lookin' like a dummy, I really don't give a fuck
Your money ain't my fuckin' money
Got a pocket full of money, c'mon homie, throw it up

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
The West coast warlord and the future is today

'Cause tomorrow that shit never come
I worry 'bout today and this urban decay
I worry 'bout Hip-Hop, when did it flip-flop?
Get whack and turn into gridlock

I don't know, is it a government plot?
I don't give a fuck whether you love it or not
That's all we got and if you throw it away
You dumb as OJ, off a for-tay

In your Izod, this the rap God
What'chu gon' put up in your iPod?
Downloader, what'chu gon' do
When your favorite MC got to sue you?

'Cause he got to eat, ain't nothin' taboo
Get your ass beat by Erykah Badu
'Cause you wanna steal this good music
Put me out of business, now you lose it

Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
That shit never come
This is very hard to swallow
Get your ass up, man
Keep your hand up on that throttle
You better ride all day, ride all night
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

Tomorrow, I'ma handle my business
But today, I'ma drink this liquor
'Cause tomorrow I might be a little quicker
But today I'm just the same old nigga

You know that shit is still a day away
Do yo' thang baby, put your life on layaway
'Cause everybody is Nostradamus
Boy, don't you know that tomorrow ain't promised?

To all the lil' mamas
Don't do a nigga like Isiah Thomas
If you a bitch, please be honest
Actin' like a hoe, you're not an angel

While you're daydreamin 'bout your future
Motherfucker come around the corner and shoot you
Don'tcha get stuck in neutral
Put your shit in drive, while you still alive 'cause

Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
That shit never come
This is very hard to swallow
Get your ass up, man
Keep your hand up on that throttle
I'ma ride all day, ride all night
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

Tomorrow, that shit never come
I know it sounds strange but today is never done
I'm up in the Range when the clock strikes one
While y'all countin sheep, I'm countin' Benja-mons

Up on my feet at the break of the sun
President of the Gangster Nation
We don't go to war, we go to the store
We rob from the rich and give to the poor

Hip-Hop, oh what a bore
Lettin' college motherfuckers run the front door
Fuck that, let's take it back to the streets
Don't let Viacom dictate the heat

The nerve of them, I never heard of them
Askin' me about my urban spins
And if I got about a thousand of them
I'm a great MC accordin' to them, fuck that

Tomorrow, don't you worry 'bout tomorrow
That shit never come
This is very hard to swallow
Get your ass up, man
Keep your hand up on that throttle
We're gon' ride all night, ride all night
Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow


This is very hard to swallow

Keep your hand up on that throttle


Don't you worry 'bout tomorrow

I am the one, that you heard about, read about
I am the one, that had to take the ghetto route
I am the one, don't make me pull this ghetto out
I'm comin' straight from the cave who let him out
Crazy nigga thought he was gone, but he ain't gone
Even King Kong took his black monkey ass home
When I hit the block, watch them scatter like roaches
So don't be fake, 'cause I know what a hoe is
Handle my business, no playin' 'cause I'm focused
You the definition of what a fuckin' joke is
When they see you comin', they play with your emotions
Fuck with my emotions and they find you in the oceans
Yeah I said oceans, yeah I mean plural
My boy got a knife to turn a boy into a girl
We'll fuck up your world, no boos to my drama
We'll include yo mama, if you fuck with my commas
I ain't tryin' to scary you
I ain't tryin' to hear you
I ain't tryin' to control that nigga in the mirror
I'll I'm tryin' to is bark before I fight
Before I take you down, might as well be polite

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go

Now when I roll through the hood, lil' kids watch my every move
Tryin' to be a good example, don't make me bury you
If you sit on my swagger, bitch take some carellflu
Don't underestimate the damage caused by a '22
Pop yo' ass right behind the ear within' hear
Nothin' like a firecracker, hits you like a linebacker
Don't forget the grind factor, I am a grinder
And here's a reminder, ain't no tellin' where they find ya
Now what this got to do with the price of tea in China?
Nothin' mothafucka just don't act like a vagina
You won't catch the rath of this hardcore rhymer
Now you got 55 niggas right behind ya
Now you wanna talk it out, but we don't negotiate
Now you gotta do all kind of shit that we know you hate
Straight from the west and we got to be respected
Here it's going down, here 'em runnin' for the exit

Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Hear 'em say, oh my God, here he come, here he come
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be no hero, you nothin' but a zero
Don't tryin' to be a hero, you nothin' but a zero
A nigga for the people, where ever they go we go

See this boy in this bitch gonna ape shit
Glitch Mob niggas takin' off like a spaceship
Pace those to Euros, eatin' those green and great chips
Get 'em by the bag, you can say we Feedo Lay chips
I'm so hungry that I can eat these niggas faces
Beat the plastic surgeons givin' Hollywood a face lift
Off the grape shit, and I'm feelin' like I'm faceless
The Mob you ain't in, nigga don't say shit
You ain't nothin' to play with, nigga I beat the basics
Cock and spray shit, quick to leave a nigga faceless
Playin' Superman, we get a brave nigga sprayed quick
Niggas can't fade this, music for the ages
Because we get it in like Young Crush
She be payin' big fishin'
In the water bitch you in the deep end
Boy I pull you deep in, underneath the deep end
Nigga have you sinkin', when I hear you creepin', hear you sayin'

Yeay.
Wassup Crip Loco
Yeah, uh, ya nigga shot me last night
Smoked a nigga for nuttin'
What the fuck.

Why the fuck you wanna murder me?
Your punk ass never heard of me
I never did nothin' to your family
Still you wanna kill a young nigger randomly
You wanna take the life God handed to me
Send it back to him, coz you ain't a fan to me
Scary bitch with a gun that ain't a man to me
That's an animal, a fucking cannibal
I'm Jeronimo and Hannibal, we international
Gangsta bull I'm a bull in Barcelona
With a karona
You's a fake ass nigger, where's ya owner?
I'm real live man, you a persona,
Now I'm a goner, call ma momma in the corner
Mister gun man, your plan is working
Coz niggers is dying and mommas is hurting

Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree, now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin' The life you wastin'

I was made by the one and only G.O.D
To take my life to the T.O.P
Now here comes a motherfuckin' D.O.G
Who ain't happy til a nigger is R.I.P
Tryin' to be som'in' you saw on BET
Either T.I.P or B.I.G
I don't give a fuck what you saw on TV
But a 187 don't make a O.G.
I'm a O.G, never had to fake it
God gave me this, how you goin' take it
What you goin' tell 'em, when you get to heaven
When he asks you why did you send back his present.
Who the fuck are you, you motherf**king peasant
Even got the nerve to ask the man for a blessin'
Send his ass to Hades with his big Mercedes
Nigger, hell on earth is being stuck in the 80's

Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree, now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin' The life you wastin'

Before you shoot me man think about it
lets go have a drink about it
Before you make a stink about it
man lets talk about it, maybe we can walk about it
But just don't be a coward
And take my life 'cause you got the power
Of the white mans gun powder
Coz you might face a gun tower
And time never run out
They take the fun out, til your life run out
So don't pull the gun out
If you ever want a house, just like Run's house
It's better than a big house
Less four-five some woman we can dig out
Find a place we can pig out
Party all night, til the owner say 'get out'

Why you wanna murder me?
You never ever heard of me
You don't know who I am
I could be part of your family tree, now
Sent by G.O.D
To save the word you and me
You never know who you facin'
Who ya chasin' The life you wastin'

Dedicated to all the niggers, thats dead and don't know why.
Who wanna look at the nigger that shot 'em
And ask these questions.

Why me homie? Why me?

Regulators, we regulate any stealing of his property
And we damn good too but you can't be any geek off the street
Gotta be handy with the steel if you know what I mean to earn your keep.

REGULATORS, mount up!

It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets, trying to consume
Some skirts for the eve, so I can get some funk
Just rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the Eastside of the LBC
On a mission trying to find Mr. Warren G.
Seen a car full of girls ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213

So I hooks a left on the 21 and Lewis
Some brothas shootin' dice so I said, "Let's do this"
I jumped out the ride, and said, "What's up?"
Some brothas pulled some gats so I said, "I'm stuck"

Since these girls peepin' me, I'ma glide and swerve
These hookers lookin' so hard they straight hit the curb
Won'tcha think of better things than some horny tricks
I see my homey and some suckers all in his mix

I'm gettin' jacked, I'm breakin' myself
I can't believe they taking Warren's wealth
They took my rings, they took my Rolex
I looked at the brotha said, "Damn, what's next?"

They got my homey hemmed up and they all around
Ain't none of them seeing if they going straight pound for pound
I gotta come up real quick before they start to clown
I best pull out my strap and lay them busters down

They got guns to my head, I think, I'm going down
I can't believe this happenin' in my own town
If I had wings I could fly, let me contemplate
I glanced in the cut and I see my homey Nate

Sixteen in the clip and one in the hole
Nate Dogg is about to make some bodies turn cold
Now they droppin' and yellin', it's a tad bit late
Nate Dogg and Warren G had to regulate

I laid all them busters down, I let my gat explode
Now I'm switching my mind back into freak mode
If you want skirts sit back and observe
I just left a gang of those over there on the curb

Now Nate got the freaks and that's a known fact
Before I got jacked, I was on the same track
Back up back up 'cause it's on
N A T E and me, the Warren to the G

Just like I thought, they were in the same spot
In need of some desperate help the Nate Dogg and the G-child
Were in need of something else one of them dames was sexy as hell
I said "Ooo I like your size"

She said, "My car's broke down and you seem real nice
Would ya let me ride?"
I got a car full of girls and it's going real swell
The next stop is the Eastside Motel

I'm tweaking into a whole new era
G-Funk, step to this, I dare ya
Funk on a whole new level
The rhythm is the bass and the bass is the treble

Chords, strings
We brings melody
G-Funk, where rhythm is life
And life is rhythm

If you know like I know
You don't wanna step to this
It's the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist

If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

Say man that nigga promised me a record deal man
That nigga promised me he was gon' come over man and do some things with me man
That nigga Snoop Dogg promised me, man the nigga promised a whole lotta stuff man
But he didn't come through man
Look nigga, I'ma promise you this

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this

Nigga had to walk 'bout four days
These niggas actin' like hoes nowadays
When I was young I used to hustle for my own shit
A 20 nigga slanging with them insane crips
I made my way out they call me Snoop Eastwood
Didn't forget where I came from, went back to the hood
Signed niggas, gave jobs and I made bail
And kept a lot of motherfuckers from goin' back to jail
Retail, hoe sale, OG's won't tell
Oh yeah they will, oh yeah they will
But I paid no mind I get back on my grind
I had a football dream to have a football league and I did that

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this

Niggas said somethiing outta place, dawg
I'ma let it go, I can't catch a case dawg
These motherfuckers prayin' on my downfall
I run the paint when it comes to this roundball
See I'm a legendary nigga doin' legendary shit
Smoking on the blunt with your temporary bitch
One thing's for certain, two thangs for sho
I'm a Long Beach nigga everywhere that I go
If I do, if I don't, if I will, if I won't
See time is money and it's the first of the month
Quit actin' funny my nigga
And go get your money my nigga
He do, 3, 2

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this
One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this

Say man 
Look I don't even promise my wife or my kids nothin'
So what I look like promising you something nigga 
Look here you need to get a get something

One thing I never do is promise motherfuckers shit but I'ma promise you this
With your hand up you need to man up, lil' bitch
I'ma promise you this

Can't keep runnin' away

I must admit on some occasions I went out like a punk
And a chump or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect, I used to never get when all I got was upset
When niggas use to be like what's up fool?

And tried to seat a nigga like the lip for no reason at all
I can recall crip niggas throwin' C in my face down the hall
I'm kickin' it in the back of the school, eatin' chicken at three
Wonderin' why is everybody always pickin' on me

I tried to talk and tell them chill, I did nothing to deserve this
But when it didn't work I wasn't scared just real nervous
And unprepared to deal with scrappin' no doubt
'Cuz my pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out

But now in 95 I must survive as a man on my own fuck
Around with Fatlip yes, ya get blown' I'm not tryin' to show
No macho is shown but when it's on, if it's on, then it's on

There comes a time in every man's life
When he's gotta handle up on his own
Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own

Down for the count on seven chickens
Shits don't get to heaven till they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back in high school I played
It cool just so some real shit won't get full blown being

Where I'm from they let the smoke come quicker
Than an evil red neck could lynch a helpless colored figure
And as a victim I invented low key till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form, form free

Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words just freeze

It's 1995 now that I'm older stress weighs on my shoulders
Heavy as boulders but I told ya
Till the day that I die I still will be a soldier and that's all I told
Ya and that's all I showed ya

And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity
Can it be I'm a celebrity
Whose on the brink of insanity
Now don't be wishing of switchin' any positions with me

'Cuz when you in my position, it ain't never easy
To do any type of maintaining 'cuz all this gaming and famin' from
Entertainin' is hella straining to the brain
And but I can't keep runnin' I just gotta keep keen and cunnin'

First of all I'd like to start it off by saying Q-Vo
From a little vato con respecto y orgullo
With much pride, jump in the ride
Hit side to side, down the calle we slide and glide
Hitting the switches, the paint job is sticking
I'ma pop your tape in the tape deck because it's hitting
You hear it from across town
No gente don't get scared and don't let no one get you down
'cause if they do I'll be around gente
I'll turn your frowns upside down with my sounds gente
Been doing this since I was fifteen and lived through nineteen
Smoking up like Cheech and Chong having Nice Dreams
Simon


Jump in the ride, pass that ass from side to side
As this crazy cholo takes you on another crazy cholo ride
I don't really give a shit about what you're saying bitch
Hey, what time is it

If it's firme as they say and it bumps in your trunk
Then hey man that shit is getting taken
I know it's something that your hating
But us vatos aren't faking
So give it up before it's too late
'cause you'll get sprayed if you don't cooperate
And so you punks want to try me
That's what you get for trying to roll your bad ass up beside me
We do it clean, ain't nobody behind
You'll catch me on the rebound, I can't believe you think you'll find me

You wanna start, pero man don't let my quette spray

Oh down for the town for the crown that he commits
But I'm too sly, too slick so I split
Get away clean, leaving the scene
People think I live to die

I don't really give a shit about what you're saying bitch
As we go a little something like this

Lil' Rob back in the house
San Diego
Lil' Rob baby baby baby
619, 619
Lil' Rob
Oh yeah

Is it cool to fuck?

If not just suck


Verse 1:
Baby tell me is it cool to touch me
before we room it up
do you need the strawberry booms to fuck
cut up the tunes and bump
what up my name is Yukmouth
but that don't mean I eat the pussy or the butt out
or you could get the fuck out my vehic
cause, eating your pussy I can't see it
a million other bitches I could be wit
believe it, see it aint aloud in the Lexo
don't talk that way
I'll drop your ass half a block away from the ghetto
with the club via Freak Nasty
Debbie doesn't but drinking niggers bubble up Freak Nasty
pass me that baggy of doe doe
global conversation on the mo mo, dig this

If you would like to blow the endo
lets go Holiday Inn in the ego
open the no smoke out the window
roll back to back when I'm in on my business

Is it cool to fuck?

If not just suck


Verse 2:
GET IN, put your seatbelt on
I aint got no bills
plus once up the ass and the streets full of Tash

that aint gonna work
but it will for me
lets see, pull up your skirt
let me feel the monkey
it kinda smells
you fine but you got to take a shower
I could tell
lets skate, blaze the hep, crack the Henney
here, hit that
don't, thats a no, give it back
damn, you ever met a bitch that need a muzzle
I got some gin in the back you can guzzle
by the way whats your motherfuckin name?

shit, I just cross reference with game
change your train of thought
I was taught to speak now and ask questions later
cause bitches quick to catch the vapors

Is it cool to fuck?

If not just suck


Tell me whats up
Is it cool to fuck?
Tell me whats up
Is it cool to fuck?

Verse 3:
Baby tell me is it cool to fuck
but you already knowin
its 5 o'clock in the morning
where the fuck you think we going yet bitch
get blunted and beep
how we creep in Vineto 600 this week though

sit your asses
look at mesmorizes eyes that twinkle
bitches astounded by the Chinese and Peroneco
hey you, hit the showel
towels in the back, check it
and when you done bring your ass out here

surround by sounds coming out the walls
my little freak nasty bitch start coming out her draws
and all and all
she like to eat dick, a can of balls and her jaws
go down the chimney with Santa Clause

wheres my bitch?
three plus one equals four
naked motherfuckers
big orgies on the floor
bitches knees sore
rug burns, broken lamp shades
what a party this trash made

Is it cool to fuck?

If not just suck


Tell me whats up
Is it cool to fuck?
Tell me whats up
Is it cool to fuck?

Is it cool to fuck?

If not just suck

Handcuff your hoes, the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-u-u-ff your hoes


This rap here goes to all you player haters
Hand cuff your hoes, that goes to all you Captain Save-Hers
Me, my major industries gold teeth and diamonds
Been grindin' for nine and half years now I'm rhymin'
Reclinin' meal tickets couldn't be lookin' me in the eye
I'm sigh now, clown that ass like Saturday Night Live 
Because I'm all between they wife's thighs
But all jokes aside I yoke the ride and roll the weed up at the same time
While I drive I cross my heart and hope to die
Hella high, it's the mobb blowin' greenery till we die
So haters do me a favor, handcuff your briide
I creep through when your husband's at the job
Many hunners got players, baby mammas feedin' me all kinds
of hibachi shrimp and I don't even rock Versacci pimpin dudes
But when I'm through, you never knew I touched her
Got her screamin loud as hell like Chris Tucker 
Handcuff your hoes


When I step in the house 
Niggas start breakin' out 
Cause they know they hoes ain't faithful 
And I'll snatch them if I'm able 
Olly-olly-oxenfree, don't hesitate to give your hoes to me


Uh, I'm used to stabbin' top notch and border coochies
Just big booty, firm casabas, preferably groupies 
Makin' em ride they self up the wall easy
Off the expecting them, feel breezy
Do me a favor, take your hoes 
Before you find your breezy 
It'll be for life, only players when I'm beerin' at
I want the better things in life
Nice, he ain't hearin' that
I ain't the nigga to be buyin' bitches clothes
they know that and still keep
So handcuff your hoes 


Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-u-u-ff your hoes 


Hey Mrs. Big Butt 
She fight all the time 
He's been cheatin' on you, but don't worry, please dry your eyes
Just take a ride with smoke-a-lot, the master of high
, high enough to kiss the sky, on the real
I wonder why beautiful girls date fat guys
He must got his cape on tight, oh look up in the sky
, now that's a Captain Save-Her fo' sure
Me being like that no, no, no, no, no
I know some hoes don't want to be a dumb-dummy
but don't play around and disrespect my money
Like a gun I'll take you away
And if you niggas act a fool, I'll spray you with the AK
Just let me take the hoe 
Let me skip into the sunset 
I like to come and so do you
If you can take one nut then you can take two
And it's true, we likes to party 
We likes to party


Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-u-u-ff your hoes 
Handcuff your hoes, the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcuff your hoes, if the girl is yours
Handcu-u-u-ff your hoes , I'm breezy

Orale
What's up ese, Q-Vo
It's me, Lil' Rob
It's me ese
So you thought I was gone huh?
Chale
Trip

I gotta go cuz I know that the jura is coming on after me
Gotta keep it cool, I don't wanna give em a reason for blasting me
Gotta get the hell out, before they block it up and take me
And I'm in it to win it, let's begin, but God forgive me for my sins
But when, I'm pulling my rhymes and having no time for anything ellos
Just call me the wicked with style, cuz I'm dropping these pleitos
Hell, don't get me confused I'm not those vatos from Cleveland
It's Lil' Rob gangster, simon the Diego Demon, screaming
Fiending for mine knocking down your door with the beats that hump and thump
Got the llesca y cerveza so that we can get fucked up
Now I'm feeling real good, not just good I'm feeling tipsy and dizzy
Some hynas come to my town and now they're asking "Who is he?"
Referring to me so, don't need permiso
"Can I get with you?" she said "Are you ready?" and I said "Estoy listo"
Pass me the besto, then I want you to pass me my leño
I'm in love with Mary Jane, living life no mas y no menos
Man so, so don't even try to put me down cuz what comes around goes around
You see you try to put me down but I come up
Won't get myself stuck if you hynas act stuck up
Cuz I get mine anyways, any days see when I do it I do it many ways
Many ways, anyways, now I jump in the ride, hit side to side
We slide and glide throwing up the Brown Pride
So you can keep running and running but I bet you can't hide
Because I'm on the prowl and now living life to the fullest
The foolish, is Lil' Rob happy? It can't be
And so they ask how I do this
Never ever letting nobody get me down but my smiling faces and cry later
Simon, I got shot in the face but I felt a pain that's much greater
Please, please don't make me tell you what it was
But I'll probably say when I'm buzzed
Now listen to what I bring
If you should lose me you'd lose a good thing

If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing
If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing

Simon, I'm the vato bringing the oldies straight from the past past
Cuz I'm that vato that wants to make them last last
So when I'm rolling through your town
Lemme hear my self bumping, thumping, and humping
Leaving you levas in shock as I pull the llesca from my sock
They call me Crypt Keeper cuz I'm selling reefer, I could be the Grim Reaper
Cuz if you want to mess around I could keep you in the forever sleeper
So when I start coming, you better start running
I'm the vato that's gunning
And letting levas fall to the ground and holmes I think it's funny
When I'm rolling down the block I think to myself ese
It takes nothing for me to slip and trip on
Oh God I gotta get a grip on life
Before I end up in a place where the veteranos told me not to go
Thought of this as a damn place and Valley of Chino
Gotta say what's up to my homeboy Dreamer
Who's dreams just didn't really come true
Even though you're torsido the whole barrio is thinking of you
Road dogs for life, you were even there when mine was almost taken
We're living our lives to the edges
But come on and take a fool, can't let this
Go on, roll on, lemme tell you how it all goes down ese
When your living that crazy life a knife has gotta be a quette
Cuz nowadays you can't be caught slipping, I'm flipping
I'm ripping it up cuz now I'm trigger tripping
And I don't care what they think about me and
I don't care what they say
I don't care what they think, if your bleeding
I'm gonna leave you to lay
Rest in pain, insane in the brain, esto no bueno
Just pass me my leño, keeping it hot just like a jalapeño
And what I say, a price to everything
If you should lose me, you'd lose a good thing
If you should lose me, you'd lose a good thing

If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing
If you should lose me, oh yeah
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing
You'd lose a good thing

The announcer's voice from Playstation's NBA Live '97
"Welcome to Inglewood, California"

Hey hey hey
What you got to say

Verse 1
Fast bitches fast cars money and fame
this rap shit is just like the '90's dope game
Before sold out shows rocked and hoes jocked
it was all about the 'hood and that Foe Hundred block
A few scraps as a puppy dog
you had to be down
to roam that infamous neighborhood
where niggas wore the crown
It was on every morning from Manchester to Century
BG's walkin' in packs to elementary
afterschool some had 'hood patrol
and watched deals on the corner
while others had skills and hittin' drills in Pop Warner
The unforgettable good old days how it used to be
'foe niggas made the transition from a jock to a G
now the streets is nice but the police is thick
'cause niggas sick and mo' murders
committed than a horror flick
but whatever happen rappin' or not
it's the same for me
it's still I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E.
so...

Chorus
Hey hey heyy
What you got to say
Inglewooooood Inglewood echoes
Inglewood Swangin' Inglewood echoes

Verse 2
The city's full of cheddar like a cheese pizza
known for senoritas and Inglewood Familias
The landmarks in the 'hood is legendary
the fabulous Forum, the Court and the Library
The city hall is scandalous to the average tax payer
so the town done fucked around and voted me the mayor
had G's that put they life on the line and some died
but thanks to this rap we on the map worldwide
And as far as race go we probably even these days
about 50% black and the rest is esays
so we spin and we win up and down Market St.
Bitch I'm a million dollar nigga and still shop the Swapmeet
what I'm in right now probably ain't worth a hundred bucks
a beany T-shirt khakis and a fresh pair of Chucks
That's a real nigga foe you that's me so don't knock it
I got everything I need plus money in my pocket
So...

Chorus

Bridge
I.N.G. foe L.I.F.E. 

Verse 3
It seem like yesterday I was the average Y.G.
and at the blink of a eye became a household MC
From the land of sunshine gold D's and palm trees
to Japanese screamin' for a nigga overseas
But I gotta think about O.G's I got game from
remain the same nigga and can't forget where I came from
We all know money make the world go 'round
so I give back to my town and put a few niggas down
I keep my enemies close 'cause they salt shakers
mad because I travel state to state
and get paid like the Lakers
Used to like the Magic man when I was a itty bitty
but now Mack and Shaq can go half and buy the city
So...

Chorus

Bridge

Chorus

Do what you gotta do, nigga keep it tight
But make 'em understand it's W/S foe life

Bitch plated niggas in the industry
Got it in for me, but I kick back nigga life is short
And you don't wanna get put on life support

So the rappers ain't got to get they hands dirty
You wanna battle, hand a bitch the mic
You wanna squab, I'm too rich to fight

Niggas hit him, hit him, where it hurts to his head squirts puss
Infamous when you ain't kind to us
Abuse with crips and bloods, on the loose
Killa Cali all we need is an excuse

We got bitches on the left, niggas on the right
Bitches wanna fuck, niggas wanna fight
Do what you gotta do, nigga keep it tight
But make 'em understand it's W/S foe life

Just remember you niggas that want me to timber

So pass the vaseline

From the W/S connection
Punk the world aint yours
'Cause motherfuckas like you do chores

We got bitches on the left, niggas on the right
Bitches wanna fuck, niggas wanna fight
Do what you gotta do, nigga keep it tight
But make 'em understand it's W/S foe life

Y'all punk niggas don't got a choice
Yo bitch hear my voice pussy get moist
Bitches in the beauty shop, talkin' bullshit

Nappy hair hoes with earrings in they nose
Always seem to fuck the riches bros

A word to your females consumer
You given all the playas tumors with your hood rat rumors
Just because you gettin' your hair cut
Don't you got to spill yo guts and lie on my nuts

We got bitches on the left, niggas on the right

But make 'em understand it's W/S foe life

This is Lil' Rob
Lil' Rob comin at you with my own style
You wanna know about me look me up in the gang file
And you will see just how I'm living
I didn't choose nothing because the choice wasn't given to
A little vato going a little fuckin loco
Was just out of hand, not poco
Because all these vatos talkin shit about a homey
When they don't even fuckin know me
They said they kicked my ass, they say I got shot
But when I heard that I started laughing on the spot
Cause what the fuck is that all bout
They say I'm dead so I had to put this tape out
To let these levas know they're all about bullshit
And that these vatos got to quit while they're ahead
Before they look stupid
You say you don't talk shit but I know you did
So you put a filero to my neck you fuckin LEVA
What the fuck's next? A cuete to my head did I cry?
I'm not afraid to die and when I do I die with Brown Pride
I got a pussy ass voice so you say
But you listen to it anyway
You say I can't rap but where the fuck are you
Just keep talking shit cause that's what little kids do
So remember this line for the first time
You do your thing holmes, but I'ma do mine
Now fuck that shit up

{Chorus)
"Doo Wah Ditty"

Lil' Rob not even puttin' in one hundred percent
But if I did you know that no one could get close
Because I'm the man with the most
Don't brag or boast but I'm a vato from the West Coast
Southern Califa's down for the Brown thing
And San Diego is the name of the city that I was brought up in
But the gang life I was caught up in
Started backin' little levas every weekend
Yeah I know I'm skinny but I ain't down for the tweakin'
Go off smoke marijuana; si mon the Mary Jane
God damn but I don't use God's name in vain
So I take that back ese con respecto
Cause I got respect, something you'll never get though
A little vato now seventeen with a glock
I got my finger on the trigger, not afraid to pull it ese
So don't tempt the man behind the gun
Because this vato might have you on the run
And at the same time cryin, shoot down your legs
but holmes is still tryin to get away
But hell ya gotta pay
Pump the fucker back and let the shotgun spray
Until you lie there dead
Just for talkin shit you got a bullet in your head
So if you persist to go on with the shit talkin
You best keep walking cause this vato's gonna be stalking your ass
Harassing it more than the hura
Or maybe not the hura pero homey keep trucha
Or better yet just don't fuck around ese
Cause I don't like killing off the Brown ese
So remember this line for the second time
You do your thing holmes but I'ma do mine

Hey, let's party y'all
All I wanna do is have a good time
Tonight it's goin' down
Hey, just roll it up
It don't matter who's at the party
Somebody's leavin' with me

Hey, let's set it off
I see the girl that I want, that I want
I see the girl that wants me
Hey, it's gettin' hot
But before my body gets bothered
Let me tell you this about me

Momma kicked me out when I was sixteen
Woke up the next mornin' with some D O G
I felt a little bad but I had money
Went and bought some dope and some blue khakis

While you were hangin' out in the promised land
I was growin' up on the Long Beach sand
So if you're intentions were to leave with me
Remember when I'm satisfied
I'm just as cold as can be, stone cold

Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby

Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby


Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby

Stone cold, baby, stone cold, baby
Stone cold, baby


Damn, this is a cavi beat
I feel like takin' time on this beat
To smash you all
But teachers are supposed to teach
So I'ma teach and you gon' listen
Or else you got to fall

To battle that's a thing that I've always done
Never lost a battle that means I'm number one
Don't hang with cowards 'cos they always run
If you be rollin' with cowards don't forget your gun

Damn, I really love to compete
Another victim I would love to delete
Come one, come all
Taste the agony of defeat
But I know how sneaky niggas can be
Whenever they fall

Some niggas try to take my cash
Dumb niggas try to make me blast
These days it's kinda hard to laugh
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past

Some niggas try to take my cash
Dumb niggas try to make me blast
These days it's kinda hard to laugh
I gotta host of new friends I never had in the past

Now life for me 
Livin on the streets 
Used to be, hectic, scandalous 
The people I meet 
When I'm on these streets 
They can be, crazy, and dangerous 
When you're broke as you can be
And you're on them streets
You have to be, cunning, homey
Keep your hand 
On the hardest man 
Or you may be, a dead man


Crazy, dangerous 

Craa-azy, dangerous

Time for the payback ese
And I don't give a fuck about your fuckin ass
Chrome to the dome and this crazy vato's not afraid to blast
you wanted PEDO but there was something
Homey that you just didn't realize
That you're fuckin with the vato that will go insane
And buck you right between the eyes
You wanted to start some PEDO
But you didn't know that the shit will never end
You fucked with the wrong vato
Now it's time for your leva's end
The payback

{Chorus 2x}
Everyone knows I've been trying
To get you back and I'm not lying

So you vatos thought I was gone right?
But I ain't one to go out like no punk ass little bitch leva
And since I'm back on the fuckin block
You best believe I'm hardcore
Much harder than before leva
So keep trucha for that payback

{repeat chorus till fades out}

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
Dopeman please can I have another hit
The Dopeman said cluck i don't give shit
If you girl kneel down, and suck my dick
Gave a nigga head, and homie tried to choke her
but he didnt care, cause she aint nothing but a smoker
Thats the way it go, thats the name of the game
Young niggas gettin over by slangin caine
Lex around my wrist in 18K heaven
Bitches clockin on my dick twenty four seven
Plus I'm makin' money, keepin baseheads waitin
Roll the six four with all gold Daytons
Live in Inglewood, California, CA.
This oozy up your ass if i dont get paid
Niggas beggin for credit, I'm knockin out teeth
Clockin much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad a money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo you wanna whole chicken, Mack 10 got plenty
To be a dopeman, boy you must qualify
Dont get high off your own supply
From a Key to a G, Its all about money
Ten piece for a ten, base pipe come free
If people out there not hip to the fact
If you see somebody gettin money for crack
Hes the.

Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 

You need a nigga with money, so you get a Dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She like his car, and he get with her
Got a black eye, Cause the Dopeman hit her
Let that slide, and you pay it no mine
Find that hes slappin you all the time
But thats okay, cause hes so rich
And you ain't nothing but the Dopeman's bitch
Do what he say, and you keep your mouth shut
Talkin' that drag might get ya fucked up
You sit and cry, If the Dopeman strike you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's another girl in the Dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She call a Strawberry, and everyone knows...
Strawberry, Strawberry is the neighborhood hoe
Do anything for a hit or two, give a bitch a rock
She fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you Ghonorea
If people out there, not hip to the fact
Strawberry is a girl, sellin pussy for crack
to the.

Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 

If you smoke caine, you a stupid motherfucker
Know around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searchin for a piece of rock
Fienin for a hit, and you lookin for more
Done stole a Alpine out of Wavy six four
Smokin like a train, man I wouldn't want to be you
Done took from the homies, betta run, when i see you
Ballin everyday, doing more drug deals
Rollin' round town, on the twenty inch wheels
If people out there, not hip to the fact
if you see Mack 10, you can ask me for crack
I'm the...

What's up dog?
What you need nigga?
Aw shit one time!

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit

but he didnt care, cause she aint nothing but a smoker
Thats the way it go, thats the name of the game
Young niggas gettin over by slangin caine
Lex around my wrist in 18K heaven
Bitches clockin on my dick twenty four seven
Plus I'm makin' money, keepin baseheads waitin
Roll the six four with all gold Daytons
Live in Inglewood, California, CA.
This oozy up your ass if i dont get paid
Niggas beggin for credit, I'm knockin out teeth
Clockin much dollars on the first and fifteenth
Big wad a money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo you wanna whole chicken, Mack 10 got plenty
To be a dopeman, boy you must qualify
Dont get high off your own supply
From a Key to a G, Its all about money
Ten piece for a ten, base pipe come free
If people out there not hip to the fact
If you see somebody gettin money for crack
Hes the.

Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 

You need a nigga with money, so you get a Dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She like his car, and he get with her
Got a black eye, Cause the Dopeman hit her
Let that slide, and you pay it no mine
Find that hes slappin you all the time
But thats okay, cause hes so rich
And you ain't nothing but the Dopeman's bitch
Do what he say, and you keep your mouth shut
Talkin' that drag might get ya fucked up
You sit and cry, If the Dopeman strike you
He don't give a fuck, he got two just like you
There's another girl in the Dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch, but far from a wife
She call a Strawberry, and everyone knows...
Strawberry, Strawberry is the neighborhood hoe
Do anything for a hit or two, give a bitch a rock
She fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the Dopeman's dick
Strawberry, just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around, she'll give you Ghonorea
If people out there, not hip to the fact
Strawberry is a girl, sellin pussy for crack
to the.

Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 

If you smoke caine, you a stupid motherfucker
Know around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searchin for a piece of rock
Fienin for a hit, and you lookin for more
Done stole a Alpine out of Wavy six four
Smokin like a train, man I wouldn't want to be you
Done took from the homies, betta run, when i see you
Ballin everyday, doing more drug deals
Rollin' round town, on the twenty inch wheels
If people out there, not hip to the fact
if you see Mack 10, you can ask me for crack
I'm the...

Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman 
Dopeman, Dopeman

Shit, man
Fuck that pinche jura ese
If they only knew where the fuck I was, right
Right underneath their pinche puerco noses and shit
They ain't gonna catch me ese
I'm too Goddamn sly, slick, and wicked
Fuck these fucking juras
Can't fuck with my crazy life
Simon ese, I'm that crazy little vato roaming the barrio homeboy
That's where you find me every fucking night creeping
Simon, it's my crazy life ese
Mi vida loca

A crazy ass rola so let me tell ya
A crazy fucking rola from this crazy fucking fella
Sort of like Capone, Godfather, or Scarface
A crazy little vato brought up in my crazy race
 The race of the Brownest
Where every Mexicano lives to be the downest
Crazy ass stories plotted in a crazy barrio
Where the vatos do bad but have nothing to be sorry for
Shooting down putos, an everyday thing
Someone call the ambulance, cuz the fat hyna sings
But it's not over, seems like it will never end
Just when you think it's through, nah holmes it just begins
Over and over sort of like a loop
Someone gets shot, it's time to go back and shoot
Those fucking levas for fucking around with the wrong man, but
Should have thought before your actions, so holmes I'm too clever
Everything I've seen, everything I've heard, but you can't amaze me
Mi vida loca, life is crazy


It's called the crazy life
Mi vida loca
It's called the crazy life
Mi vida loca
It's called the crazy life
Mi vida loca
It's called the crazy life

Back with some shit that some people flip on
Before your trip ese, here's something for you to trip on
Talking about killings, and living life in a craze
Smoking Mary Jane, hell sprung in a daze
Sick of pulling crumbs cuz they're thinking that crime pays
Damn Raza, we got to change our evil ways
But back to this motherfucking wickedness
All these punks talking shit and I'm sick of this
Talking about I'm bigger than you so what you gonna do
I'm the vato holding a shotgun, you're the vato holding the .22
But just because I'm smaller don't mean that I won't fight ya
Do anything to win even if I have to bite ya
And if I lose, it's time to shoot down a solca
As you're lying dead I pull out the bag of mota
Roll up the le? and spark up my joint
Proud because I killed this vato with my hollow point
But what am I to do when this vato is to strike me
I kicked him two times cuz he got blood on my Nikes
Fuck em, buck em, stuck em, who give a fuck
Oh you vatos want some petho, well don't press your fucking luck
But you'll die,  people want to know
It's my crazy life, mi vida loca en mi barrio



Simon the quette's pointed at cha you see mi vida loca
Giving you a taste, got the mad dog on my face
Oh you see the three dots, and I hear are the three shots
Bang bang bang, then walk away like nothing happened
I usually feel the diziness but this time I wasn't feeling this
I guess you could say this crazy vato is used to it
Making all you little fucking levas bite the bullet
Bite the bullet I said motherfucker
Bite the bullet, twice I pulled it
Not giving a fuck about you ese
You got your lips wrapped around the barrel of my quette
Now you're trying to tell me what yo want to do
They say your homies are after me, but saves que I'm after them too
It makes no fucking difference to me
A young SD MG L-I-L R-O-B
What's up ey

What's up mija
I was wondering if maybe I could stop by and pick you up tonight
Shine up the wingtips throw on the zoot suit
Jump in the Bomba complete with the moonroof
Pick up my lady and kick it with her all night
We look up and we could see the rain fall right
down on the glass, we can't see the splash
We're cruising slow forget fast
You see a vato like me takes my time
I'm dressed to impress and my hyna's lookin fine
She loves me, I love her and everything is right
It's the Pachuco's night
I got the 45 player under the dash
In the ashtray I got some marijuana ash
I got the .45's in the glove
She throws on "Natural High" and says it's time to make love
I said damn mija yo te quiero mucho contodo mi corazon
She said mijo I'm glad that we're alone
Because it's time I confess how i feel
She said mijo I love you and I said baby I'm for real
It's the Pachucos night
It's the Pachucos night

You know mija there ain't nothin I'd rather do
Than to spend a little time with you
Cause you're my lady and I love you

{Chorus}
Stay right here baby 
I'm not ready to let you go, ahha yeah
Stay right here baby, ahha yeah
So i could love you and love you forever

I'm kicking back with my lady
But still some vatos rolled up
Where you from holmes?
I'm thinking to myself don't act dumb holmes
Could pull the cuete cause I never leave home without it
But would that prove anything? ey holmes I doubt it
Vatos actin up I didn't say nothing but I stared
They call me a chavala but hey I didn't care
Time to go on roll on catch em on the rebound
Some may call me a wrecker
Some might say that proves I'm down
Or got respect for the woman that I'm with
Cause if she wasn't with me you know I'd do it with the quickness
You see I handle things in the right way
It's me and my ruca, no need to pull out the fusca
Can't let them ruin my night so I drive off in the rain
She said mijo you're the best and so I told her the same
I grab her leg and tickle it as she laughs and yells stop
When I only stop to start all over again
You must've put a spell on my mind
You're my genie and my lover
And i wish that you would make our time stand still
Chills and thrills is what you give me
Everytime that I'm next to you
I'm so glad I found the best with you
A dream come true is me and you
A Pachuco's night doing what lovers like to do
And mija you're the only woman that can drive me crazy
A Pachucos night just me and my lady

{Chorus}

I've got to got to let you know who you are
I wanna take you home with me
And you will see that you love me and I love you
Lucky cause it's no fun being lonely
But with me you'll never have to be the lonely one
Cause you're my hyna
and you best believe the only one
She whispered in my ear come here
You're the only man I'll ever need
Because you've always been right there for me
Two hearts joined as one
Having fun on what I call my Pachucos night
My night ain't done
Until you come on and go with me
Over to my place and make love between the sheets
That's where our bodies meet
Te gusto mucho this Pachuco's gonna love ya
Because I can't seem to get enough of ya
Because mija you're the one droppin spells
it's me and my lady and the Sharilles
*{This is dedicated to the one I love}*
Let me lay you down
Let me make you feel just like you should
In other words mija let me make you feel real good
She's lookin firme so her body I caress
She said let's vistame and so I help her undress
And it's like I love need and want you baby
It's time to get crazy

{Chorus}

ESE, CHOLO!


Orale holmes, this is Lil' Rob
Comin after you from San Diego, Southern Califas

Mexican gangster yeah that's the name of the jam
And it's to all those locos that like to gangbang
Because I do it when I have to when it's every fuckin week
And always kickin it with my homies
But could swear they're always tweaking
But the only drug I use is marijuana
People tell me not to smoke it
But I'll smoke it if I wanna
Cause right now living in the fast lane
So tell me what's wrong with smoking a little bit of Mary Jane
And when I fight I fight mano a mano
Por que si mon I'm a down ass Chicano
I'll say it again I'm down for mine ese
Or laugh at you if you need a shank over a cuete
And then I'll call you a chavala
As I rock over the jam in my '62 Impala
And if you shoot you better kill
Cause if you don't and you won't
But then I will
You won't rest in peace you'll rest in pain
Why, because my mind clicks
To be insane in the brain
Si mon I'm fuckin bad to the bone
And all I could say is don't fuck around holmes
Cause I'm a...

{Chorus 2x}
Mexican Gangster, 
Mexican Gangster, 
Mexican Gangster, 
Mexican Gangster born with the badness

Kickin that Cisco, smokin and tokin we heard a blast
You should've seen how fast we jumped off of our ass
We ran outside just to check out what it was
It's a Mexicano thing
I ain't no Crip or Blood
Dark in the garden so I couldn't see
Though I looked to the light and I saw my Primo
Laying there moaning; That's all I hear
But right now Lil' Rob ain't got time to shed a tear
We picked him up, we took him home and called the ambulance
Those vatos fucked up good
Cause now they're gambling with their lives
And it's about time they lose
Never fuck with the vato in the Sureno blues
To the Mexicana Madre, let's pull a drive-by
So when we lose one, that's when they seem to lose about five
But we're not satisfied holmes until they all die
So orale let's jump in my lowride
Toma las llaves I threw 'em in the ignition
Orale now we're on another fuckin mission
Turn on the radio on came the Rollas
Homeboys in the back loading up the pistolas
Orale they're loaded
It's time to do it
I just got my drivers license cause I'm 16 with a bullet
Not alone, my homeboy's in his Bomb
And to you puto's you won't last long
See I'm with my homies and all of them are packin
You vatos fucked up now the shells will be stackin
16 With a bullet pero bad to the bone
Don't fuck around holmes cause I'm a...

{Chorus}

Now as we're driving away I hear a youngster say
"Yo Lil' Rob let me blow that mothafucker away"
I said "Chales, jump out the ride"
He opened up the door and then he jumped outside
he said "Orale", then "arrato"
I said "Hey we'll be back little vato"
So off we go to the other barrio
Not cruising too fast we're always cruising slow
We saw somebody started running cause they took a glance
They didn't have time to shit their pants
Take a look over there, damn some fine hynas
Too bad they're playing dice throwing their signs at us
But it's alright
We're looking for the fool who shot my Primo
Cruisin slow and guess who we see so
We crept up in the Bomba and took a look
So Lil' Rob said "Que onda"
I said fuck it jumped out the bucked he had a bat
So he swung and so I duck and I saw his face
So I stuck it with a right left, right left
I made him suffer holmes
And then I put the nine milli to his backbone
I said "Hey mothafucker don't breathe
Cause right now Lil' Rob really wants to see you bleed"
I flipped him over put the gun between his eyes
I said "You fucked up once and I hope
that's what you realize, now how the fuck does it feel
You played at your own risk and now you found out I'm for real"
Boom boom back in the raffla I'm reminiscing
With a tear in my eye cause it's my raza that I'm killing
Looking at him dead in the face I shot him twice
Now fuck that shit for sure will get 7-25 to life
But fuck that shit it's time to go home
No longer cruising slow I'm rushing to my canton
I'm thinking what my Primo wanted me to do
You think he'd want me to serve life for a punk or two
Or even cry over him for a couple of days
Damn raza we've got to change those evil ways
Though soy chingon cabron
Like Al Capone always holding my own
Walking alone in the S-D anger zone
Si mon bad to the bone
Not the one to talk shit over the telephone
And San Diego is the place where all my homeboy's roam
And all I could say is don't fuck around holmes
Cause I'm a...

{Chorus 3x}

Talking: the record you about to hear is basically true.
The names have been changed to protect the guilty. 

Some breathe gangsta shit,
We dream of gangsta shit 

Verse 1
I hit licks nigga lead the hood in strong arm
'bout to get more chickens than foster farms
Now give it up or die this a mothaf**kin' jack
Hustlas guard yo sack the chicken hawk is back
Impatiently waiting out of hunger
My instinct to kill got stronger
My wingspan's longer
My guns loaded up and before you know what hit you
I jump off the wire swoop and then I get you
And f**k a tussle bitch cause all I do is shoot
Put lead in ya dome take ya sack and ya loot
With a foe foe  revolver so my strap ain't a jammer
I want pure peruvian no cuttin' arm & hammer
Gotta take what I need that's how the ball bounces
Now decide if you go die over thirty six ounces
Before I go make sure no cameras in the vents
Pull a feather from my tail and dust off my claw prints
Nigga

Chorus
You knew that I was dangerous
When ya took it


Look the chicken hawk two is after you

In search of super chicken 


Verse 2
Yo girl gave me the cock
But now she holla rape
So I take her to my nest
And wrap her with the duct tape
Pull my heat out squeeze and make these teflons melt her
And watch blood drip all down the walls like heltah skeltah
Take flight over the woods to drop the body
And hit a lake to rinse off 'cause my feathers all spotty
I stalk once again caught my prey by surprise
Look in his eyes if he lies he dies before sunrise
Where the work at fool the jack is on
You feel the wrath of the chrome
Kick in or get your noodles blown
So hurry the f**k up nigga take me to the safe
It ain't no time to waste with this magnum in ya face
Make one false move I swear the gunshots rang out
First i'ma kill you then i'ma blow ya bitch brains out
A hawks technicality is pecking for his salary
So keep the dope whoopin' while the hawk'll keep swoopin'

Chorus

Mack dime and that's one to grow on mothaf**kas.

I got that A to the motherfucking K

Yeah, shells stacking up I shot about thirty rounds
Out my thrity round clip, you can even hear the sounds
Of the shells when they hit the ground
But you know they're right down
Can't take chances if you plan to fuck around
Leaving prints on a shell, life in a jail cell
With no bail living life in Hell
So I precede to be the sly, slick, and wicked
But will I get caught? In the mean time a puto gets shot
I say it's nothing if you ask me
I got pumps, you can call them punks man, they wanna blast me
That only figures when you're living life crazy
They wanna keep me from rapping 'cause they know it pays me
Orale that's what I say
Orale puto that's what I say before I spray
All them fucking levas and I cap cap cap
And then I come back and make a firme rap rap rap
And tell everybody what I just did
Lined up some levas and I just got rid
Of a couple right on the double, I'm nothing but trouble
But when it comes to hynas I'm the one that likes to cuddle
But right now the shells are stacking up
I got my thirty rendevous and fools are backing up
I got that AK in the trunk for punks that wanna act dumb
Fuck the fourty round clip, I got the seventy five round drum
You vatos tempt me now I don't give a fuck
Size don't mean shit when my shells are stacking up


I got my shells stacking up

I got my shells stacking up

I got my shells stacking up

I got my shells stacking up


Simon they got me on the leva
Don't give a shit, I'm listo
Homies drinking besto, one smoking up the crystal
I've got the pistol in my hand keeping trucha
For any rivals or the jura
The ones rolling down the hood is dead tonight
Something's gonna happen just like it always does right
We're in a spot where we see them but they can't see us
So when they try to bust we bust on them busters
Now hiding out, just keeping trucha
Roll through my hood, just think that we might shoot ya
You won't leave without bullet holes ese
So it doesn't matter to me if you got your quette
'cause you won't know where the fuck to shoot back
All you hear is rata-tat-tat rata-tat-tat
And if you roll through it's time for the payback
Time to cruise your hood holmes, now what you think about that
I'll roll your fucking hood without a care
See some levas over here so some levas over there
What the fuck are they gonna do to me
'cause I'm too sly, too slick, too W-I-C-K-E-D
Soy chingon, fuck em all
See some levas standing then you see some levas fall
As I spray and make their day
Say "Fuck you putos" now it's time for the get away
But I can't split until at least one dies
So I got back and give the vato a Columbian Necktie
Oh shit, here comes his homies around the corner, they're coming
Should I be running? Fuck no, I should be gunning
Pull out my quette from behind my belt, shit
Because these vatos just want to be delt with
You fuck with me man, I don't give a fuck
Size don't mean shit when my shells are stacking up



A crazy little vato when I'm stacking up the balas
I don' give a fuck about you punk ass chavas
Simon, I bring down my locs
Gotta look good when I kill so I sparkle up the spokes
You see you're nothing but a lop
You think that you can rap? Bitch you can't even walk
It's like wibble y wobble y wibble y wobble
You're a chicken, you're a turkey, bawk bawk, gobble gobble
Simon, when you gobble my nutts
You get this kind of treatment 'cause you're nothing but punks
But uh, enough about you fools
I'm not saying all that but next to you I'm way cool
And to you people that wanna know, I'll let you guess
Yeah to you putos, yeah holmes the Brown Crowd's the best
And I'm stacking up the shells
Having an Oh What A Night sort of like the Dells
But not in love, I'm on a killing spree
Killing off you fucking putos who fuck with me
So remember this ese when I don't give a fuck
Keep trucha homey 'cause my shells'll be stacking up



Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie
Gangsta boogie

"'Squeak Ru:"'

You know sometimes life is a trip
It can make you do mysterious thangs
And sometimes life is a bitch
How do you deal with the pain?
Niggas rather smile in my face
Stick a knife in my mothafuckin' back
Than to see my family doin' well
And my pockets steady gettin' fat
Since the age of 14 you know
I been representin' my neighborhood
G'd up every goddamned day
Puttin' it down foe the city of Inglewood
And I ain't asked nobody for shit
Ain't nobody had to front me no sack
Everything I got I did it by myself
And that's a mothafuckin' fact
But why when I'm doin' my own thang
And why when I'm on my own grind
Niggas wanna turn they back
And act like Squeak done switched sides
And even though I got niggas that I love
And niggas that I know is real
I still got them niggas that I wanna
Take my pistol and stick it to they fuckin' grill
But have you ever been down wit the homies
Because you thought the homies was true?
Or have you ever been down wit the homies
And found out the homies ain't down with you?
Huh, player haters suck my dick!

Oh what a night

This is dedicated to the 6.1.9.
These other vatos had theirs, and now it's my time
No kick a beat, smooth suavecito
To all you fine Chicanas, Lil' Rob estoy mejito
Thumping the oldies
It's me Lil' Rob, and the Brown Crowd homies
Turn up the volume, yah Natural High
I smile for my friends and later on I'll cry
For La Raza, because we're killing off each other
It's sad, damn there goes another
But we don't need that cuz tonight is our night
The Brown Crowd night and everything will be alright
So get up the Crowd, and do the Brown thing
Let's cruise, no need to gang-bang
So get ready, dressed to impress
Because you gotta make this night your very best
Not just another night on the town
It's the Brown Crowd, Chicano and proud and proud to be Brown
So when you're cruising in your lowrider
Let down the back and put the front a little higher
And now you're rolling TJ ready
Just be yourself holmes, no need to be fake
Because everyone out here just having a good time
Oh what a night in the 6.1.9.

*scratches*
.oh what.
.oh what.
.oh what a night.

It's a nice night so I drop the top
Hynas tripping out when my 62 rocks
Pop the Proper Dos, simon Mexican Power
Everybody's cruising about five miles per hour
Lift up the back, drop the front, the frame scrapes
Cars in a spark show because it had sprayed case
But saves que, is what I'm gonna do
Don't want to doubt finest, la la la means I love you
Cuz when you're cruising with Rob you're cruising to all the bad jams
I hit my switches up and then it slams
Up goes the front, the back drops down
Continental kicks, dipping the ground
All the hynas checking out the Brown Crowd
Because we got the Brown Crowd bumping loud
That's when we see some fine ass hynas walking
So I pulled up to the curb and said "Hey girl, you wanna jump in?"
They said "Yeah," so I said "Orale"
That's for my homeboy Negro cuz es muy chate
I said "Just jump in the ride"
Cuz tonight's oh what a night and things about to get live
Now cruising with the hynas but still cruising with the homies
Turn up the volume, still cruising with the oldies
Tonight belongs to me holmes, it's mine
Oh what a night in the 61-bad-ass-9

*scratches*
.oh what .
.oh what .
.oh what a night.

Now there is no better way to end oh what a night
Then to kick it with some fine ass hynas that you like
And me being from Diego, take a word from the wise
All the hynas in the 6.1.9. are nothing but cuties pies
That's when this hyna whispers in my ear
And tells me things that make me glad that I'm still here
Put on my Brown Crowd jacket so that I don't freeze
Pop in the tape, The Best of The Tempries
Looking at this hyna, I'm gonna play my hunch
That's when this hyna tells me that I beat her to the punch
Threw on Mary Wells cuz that's the thing to do
I said "I beat you to the punch cuz I'm the one who really loves you"
The Brown Crowd gots game, I don't mean to be bragging
Even though some hynas don't like the pantalones sagging
I still seem to have fun
They call me stuborn cuz I won't pull my pants up for no one
My ranfla's getting hot, it's time to rest my ride
So what are we to do? I guess go watch the tide
So me and her are walking on the beach kicking up sand
That's when she lets me know that she's a Brown Crowd fan
Kicking out my plan, no longer willing
Cuz right now it's all about time for confessing the feeling
Now what happens next, homeboy nevermind
Oh what a night in the 6.1.9.

*scratches*
.oh what .
.oh what .
.oh what a night.

In the 6.1.9.

Oh what a night

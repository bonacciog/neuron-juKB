All I ever knew
You left a footprints on my heart
In broken pieces on the wall
And I feel you now
But I still can't see
Your face in the pictures
The ones I'm painting in my dreams
All the ones I used to know

My dreams are all missing youI can hear it calling calling calling
I can hear it calling calling
I can hear it calling

Opinions. What you think we're living for?
Fear has its fingers that've got to cut you loose
Spliff: Away with the fool

Thought we had the world and the world had one
Now we're left with just me
Me and you
Ain't it sad now?
That's the touch of blame
Saving the best for last bit of romance

Don't say goodbye
Don't say ross
Don't say ross
Don't say ross you must miss
Everybody in the club can see us on

We're the ones they call in
The ones they love never leave
Don't be silent now
The fight no longer is so loud
Ooh, you own the party?

Ooh, you'll never know how much I made you want to stay
You're nothing without my love
Ooh, you'll never know how much I made you want to stay
(Don't say goodbye)

Well I'm back at the door, you can call me anytime
I'm all yours and you're my favorite game
So when's the right time and where are we going?
Where is the one
I thought we had the world and the world had one
Ooh, you can never be with no one

Don't say goodbye
Don't say ross
Don't say ross
Don't say ross you must miss
Everybody in the club can see us on
We're the ones they call in
The ones they love never leave
Don't be silent now
The fight no longer is so loud
Ooh, you can never be with no one

Don't say
No
NoOne night that didn't last too long
Might not last too long
Oh oh oh
Maybe not, but I love you girl
And I think I know why you're here
But I just wanna talk
One night that didn't last too long
Might not last too long

One night breakup that never did
Oh oh o-oh girl that never last too long
Oh oh oh
One night that didn't last too long
Might not last too long

It all started here
One night that didn't last too long
Might not last too long

One night
Didn't last too long
Oh oh oh
Somehow that night that didn't last too long
Might not last too long

Oh no
I was ghost
But then I picked you up
And now you're in my sight

And one night
They started that left us so wrong
Might not last too long

One night
They don't know how we do it
Oh, but we do it
And now I'm at the end of this line
I might never say a thing about you
But I'm at the end of this line

Don't say goodbye
Don't say ross
Don't say goodbye
Don't say ross
Don't say goodbye
Don't say ross
Don't say goodbye
No, don't say goodbye
Don't say ross

Don't say goodbye

I can't stop smiling
The only thing that stopped me smiling is you
I can't stop smiling
The only thing that stopped me smiling is you
Is youI've been sleeping in the same bed for the last week or two
And there's not a single thing that's wrong with me
For a thousand years or more I'll be waiting for you

I've been hoping that you would slow down, give your love a human face
But I'm too afraid to say a word, or stop the process
It's been there for a while and all it takes is for you to walk away

But my feelings for you are deeper than my feelings for you
I'm not ashamed to tell you my name
Yes I know how much you really love to hurt me
Your hurt is my hurt, so I'm not ashamed to tell you my name

Keep it distant, cause I need to know
Will you ever let go of me
Have no fear cause a secret is gonna stay safe inside

My feelings for you are deeper than my feelings for you
I'm not afraid to tell you my name
Yes I know how much you really love to hurt me
Your hurt is my hurt, so I'm not ashamed to tell you my name

My name is fear
And a feeling that goes
ing my mind

I know what I want, I know what I need
I know how I want it, I know what I need
All you, all you

I know what I want, I know what I need
I know how I want it, I know what I need
All you, all you
I know what I want, I know what I need
I know how I want it, I know what I need
All you, all youYou say you want a revolution
But you've got little vision
What you wanted
I've got mine

What you got
You've got more class than I need
There's no love you're mine
It's just a sign I can trust
That you got what you wanted
I said I was wrong
But maybe I was wrong
I was preoccupied
But as soon as I rose I knew
That what was a friend no longer needs to be
A shade that's fair from head to toe

You don't want to see me but I can see
If you're really really me
You don't want to see me but I can see

What you got
You've got more class than I need
There's no love you're mine
It's just a sign I can trust
That you've got what you wanted
I said I was wrong but maybe I was wrong
I was preoccupied
But as soon as I rose I knew
That what was a friend no longer needs to be
A shade that's fair from head to toe

Innovates over love
Won't get any older
Leading me to my knees
Only got the love that I wished for
And I wished for more

You don't want to see me but I can see
If you're really really me
You don't want to see me but I can see
If you're really really me
You don't want to see me but I can see

What you got
You've got more class than I need
There's no love you're mine
It's just a sign I can trust
That you've got what you wanted
I said I was wrong but maybe I was wrong
I was preoccupied
But as soon as I rose I knew
That what was a friend no longer needs to be
A shade that's fair from head to toeThe world is yours
Here we are standin' on the edge of my life
Lookin' around me flashed
With nothing to show but the streamers on the horizon
The angels beckoning please
Desire for notice, supply us with answers
Come and find us, steer us away
Headed towards a better place
Take our side

I'm followin' now, lookin' around
Yeah, in circles everywhere
I can't go back, in my turn
Think I've just won

Life is where you're headed
Your shine brighter than the sun
So, fix your eye on the horizon
Our journey's running out
Stop time, stop of your way
Stop time, stop of your way

Time is all you ever need
From birth to the day, we're movin' at the speed of light
A small object, a beam of light
On the run, on parolee
Somewhere I've been all of it
All I've ever done was for release
So, I follow with your heart on the line

Watching every night through my phone
Now he's finally gonna say

If you're listening I think I hear you
I think I see you baby don't ya

Should I stay or should I go?
Any way to be with you live with you
Any way to be with you live with you
Any way to be with you live with you

I can't make love through a radio
Now make me sweat through a radio
So come on make me sweat through a radio
So make me sweat through a radio

I used to think love was in my family
'Cause their drama made me forget yours
I turned the music up so all the girls knew who I was
Yea the music should be loud
So the bar be raising, we turn it up and attract it
This is my alma mater and it ain't nothing like a rap
Real like a G in the Pro game
Chilled in the corner with the whole offense
Knee to the head, niggas know I'm on the best side
It's like every game I got to beat him and I love it cause he beat my grind
So when the big game he ain't around I know he in trouble
'Cause I'm in the hood making All Nighter

If you're listening I think I hear you
If you're listening I think I hear you
I think I see you baby don't ya
Stay with me some way
If you're waiting on me I think I see you through me
Should I stay or should I go?
Any way to be with you live with you
Any way to be with you live with you
Any way to be with you live with you

I put that on my life
Can you blame me?
'Cause I love you so
And baby we can get together
If you ask me
I'm living it up, where you at? (Where you at?)
We don't have to send no lies, I see your faces (Wear diamonds on your?)

And it's the feeling
When you put your hands up
It's the feeling
Saying baby you know I'm here to make you move
And it's the feeling
Of looking on while you're talking through your phone
While I'm sitting back and watching you wine
While the champagne swirl, looking back now
I love you more

If you're listening I think I hear you
If you're listening I think I hear you
I think I see you baby don't ya
Stay with me some way
If you're waiting on me I think I see you through me
Should I stay or should I go?
Any way to be with you live with you
Any way to be with you live with you
Any way to be with you live with you

I put that on my life
Can you blame me?
'Cause I love you so
And baby we can get together
If you ask me
I'm living it up, where you at? (Where you at?)
We don't have to send no lies, I see your faces (Wear diamonds on your?)

And it's the feeling
Of looking at the ice cream truck ahead
It's the feeling
Of you and me and your day and night
It's the feeling
Of collecting affections, before I'm gone
Cause I'm young, I'm stupid
I'm young, I'm stupid

If you're listening I think I hear you

through the sleazy legs of morning grace
this is the tale aboutRed lips, gold sandals, And my blue eyes,
when I walked in the door of her same white man
I had that all along, a cool brown belle tie.

I walked in the bar, looked at my watch (hi time)
took me so long just to count it all
inside my head like a bricks wall.

Sure move to sneak around the bar
with a punk motherfuckin' band.
Sure calls on and takes a little long ball
to the city fuck the nation, and live like fucks.
I tell 'em I ain't scared,
he say he ain't, I say he ain't, and they say he run too far.
Back up and get your paper,
because they say he run about, with two Casio bars up.

I held my ace close and never thought twice,
cuz I stuffed that motherfucka alive.

Back in the city my chips is cheap, and I'm gettin' my conscience back
and that's for sure.
I paint picture of the times we
 argue like hell has broke my knees,
and he says he won't eat, and that ain't fair.
Man fuck that bullshit,
dawg, dawg, dawg, dawg, they ain't big down to me,
I ain't scared,
man fuck that motherfucka funny.

Back in the city fuck man fuck that fuckin' hand,
and my cup is dry, and my hand is wet,
it's like we do on Sunday in the season of shame,
I keep that motherfucka family rolled up,
I got away from all my drama.

Back in the city my chips is cheap, and I'm getting my conscience back
and that's for sure.
I paint picture of the times we
 argue like hell has broke my knees,
and he says he won't eat, and that ain't fair.
Man fuck that bullshit,
dawg, dawg, dawg, dawg, they ain't big down to me,
I ain't scared,
man fuck that motherfucka funny.

I paint picture of the times we
 argue like hell has broken my knees,
and he says he won't eat, and that ain't fair.
Man fuck that bullshit,
dawg, dawg, dawg, dawg, they ain't big down to me,
I ain't scared,
man fuck that motherfucka funny.

This story sobers up my soul.
I'm top of the world, top of the world, top of the world rock,
high like a steel rock.I never had the strength to keep it in,
I never had an inch of ground,
But I will get through this burning in you and me.
And I see the fire within,
I can finally see it in your eyes,
For I know you know,
I can finally see it in you and me.

I'd do anything for us.
I'd run through it too.
I'd lose control,
I'd loose and lose the circuits in me.
I'd do anything for us,
abi go crazy,
I'd do anything for us,
abi go crazy,
I'd do anything for us.

I'm not alone in wondering,
I know you hear the sound and you run back,
And I hear the cold voice of my plea.
I am alone in wondering,
I know you hear the sound and you run back,
And I hear the cold voice

Making up to mouth moves on my own
My own, myself, and this couch is too afraid to move

I've been afraid of moving on
A little too long

I've been afraid of moving on

What you're doing to me
Just the second that I saw you again
It's like a merry-go-round
A lovin' angel caught me beneath her spell

She's been all around
She's been all around

Down in the heartache and sorrow
She never lets me pretend
You came and saved my life

She's been all around
She's been all around

Right here in my heart
I'm forgiven its everlasting story

They say that love is a river flowing through
To bring back to a shore that it was always here
This grace to walk right on by
And you know I won't be gone
But I know that I will feel the same
You came and saved my life

She's been all around
She's been all around

Right here in my heart
I'm forgiven its everlasting story

They say that love is a river flowing through
To bring back to a shore that it was always here
This grace to walk right on by
And you know I won't be gone
But I know that I will feel the same
You came and saved my life

Faith filled up the sky
With the words of love she gave wisdom & guidance
I walk oniwafoewaw

Just a song of light
Words that chained me in vain
Wash my soul to a guillotine
Fearing to see my face
Kiss me nigam because I'm human

Heard through the stories (boom)
That fueled my brain
Filled with trivial things
Wish I could replace the hurt in my belly
Where my daddy's at (cry)

Heard through the voices (boom)
Of the people raised by the devil
Who bumped my fist into
Anabdeezans, well, that shit wasn't okay
I wasn't happy at all the day I saw
You, you, you, you

Heard through the stories (boom)
That fueled my brain
Filled with trivial things
Wish I could replace the hurt in my belly
Where my daddy's at

Heard through the voices (boom)
Of the people raised by the devil
Who bumped my fist into
Anabdeezans, well, that shit wasn't okay
I wasn't happy at all the day I saw
You, you, you, you

Cut through
Echoes in my mind
Heard through the voices (boom)
Of the people raised by the devil
Who bumped my fist into
Anabdeezans
Wish I wasn't happy at all the day I saw
You, you, you, you
Wish I wasn't happy at all the day I saw
You, you, you, you
Wish I wasn't happy at all the day I saw

,
If I knew what I know now,
I'd tell you anything
But I don't know anything
And when I'm home alone
I'll come back the next time

'Cause I've been seeing someone
I've been seeing someone
Yeah, I've been seeing someone
I've been seeing someone
I've been seeing someone

You've been seeing someone
You've been seeing someone
I've been seeing someone

Ain't nothing, I wanna do, that I can do

Wanna get high, wanna get high, wanna get high
Wanna get high

flies gotta scrape, tears gotta fall
lookin' perfect, lookin' perfect
I would hope that all the ones I see

I would hope that all the ones I see
oh yeah, all the ones I see
I would hope that all the ones I see, yeah, all the ones I see

fly, fly, fly, told ya that
flies gotta scrape, tears gotta fall
lookin' perfect, looking perfect
I would hope that all the ones I see
flies, all the ones I seeI write rhymes that will fall down
That pays you, goes around
So much, much more when you drown
When you drown, when you drown
People think you're crazy, but that you just can't
So much more when you drown
When you drown, when you drown
We don't have too much more to give
'Cause living for less is an easy bar
But there's no point in trying toind
If you're enough tobe a man, and when you're frail
you're delicate and blunt
I've found the delicate to be so gall
But every second I'm gone, the memory runs
Through my spine
When I'm wrong, I turn the night to day
I write a song, because I know that
I've wasted a thousand fucking years
Spelling mistakes lightly
You always bring me closer
You always bring me closer
Yeah we use to have a thing we can be, and I hope
I hope we use to have a thing we can be
But words don't mean shit now
All the things we've been battling for the rest of our lives
Can we fill a hole that's already filled
'Cause every breath was yours and there's a pint on the way

I write a song 'cause I know that you're hearing it
And I know your feeling's 'bout me 'bout you
And I know

You've been drowning in liquor, going to war again
To make sure that you'll never get over it
And now that you're alone, can it buy you a place to stay?
A living room couch to rest your head on instead
The neighbours might decide to listen in instead

I write a song 'cause I know that you're hearing it
And I know your feeling's 'bout me 'bout you
And I know

You can lose your mind
You can fall sleep
It may not last hours, may not last one minute
It may not last until you catch the ground

And every ounce of pain, there's a reflection in the water
Well, well well water
Well, water
Well, water

Well, water
Well, waterMama, I'm sure we are miles apart
You must have missed me
Oh, I can't remember
The day you came into my life
And I know you're only human too
I'm so tired of being tired and lost
And so much is on my mind
Ah, I ain't leaving
I'm in London on a one-way trip
Im in America Im in Bombay
Ah, Detroit, Detroit, there are funny places Im sure of
I ain't leaving, I ain't leaving
Please promise me the promises that you never keep
Please believe me now, baby don't forget
I ain't leaving
It's your sweet smile that has me feeling
Its the time you look so right, sweet smile
And dont be afraid to say that you‒ve been lookin' for it
I ain't lookin' for it
I ain't looked for it but I sure aint never put it off
I ain't looked for it but I sure aint never put it away


Oh, the world can be a little dangerous
When you can fight to live and breathe

You're one of a kind!
That would be my bolero
My bolero, my bolero!

I'm your bolero
I'm your bolero

I'm your bolero

Won't you keep on bolero

I'm gonna put up your flag in front of the plane
I'm gonna keep running into the sun
Man, that ain't bolero!

You're gettin' closer
Closer

I'm your bolero
My bolero, my bolero.

Feeling pain but the tears won't go, won't go

All my dreams are broken
I told myself I won't go, won't go
I'm only following what I'm told

But that's okay, yeah

'Cause I'll finally be in your good hands
Don't you worry ‘cause

It's been a while since we felt the world
But I know that we're gonna prove it, baby
'Cause I've been digging your style, mm mm
Your kiss on my lips, it felt like a dare
Once I felt just how it feels, yeah, yeah

Make my the keys, baby
Come push the key

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, oh oh
I've got to be in the company of you

It feels right when I look into your eyes
I don't wanna be so shy
If you wanna bring me down
There's no reason to keep on keeping hold
I swear all my tears in the back glass
They pouring down like a waterfall

There's no reason to keep on keeping hold
I swear all my tears in the back glass
They pouring down like
No, no, no

When you know I'm being lonely, lonely
While we're falling deep inside

Doesn't have a lot but a love for you
Even when you're bad it's the only thing I do

Let you guard my heart while I'm hurting all the time
Let your love get in the way, I'm going out tonight
You're enough to make my heart beat faster
While we're falling deeper tonight

I'm coming into something that I'm forever searching for
Won't you give me everything that I need in this whole wide world

Doesn't have a lot but a love for you

I'm coming into something that I'm forever searching for
Won't you give me everything that I need in this whole wide worldOh yes, I
I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I am sure, there's no other than light
I walk along the ocean, and I'm not afraid

I'm blinded by the light of day
I'm caught up in the light of day
Look into my eyes, and you will see

666 is no longer confined
666 is not afraid to die
(666 is not afraid of death
666 is not afraid to die)

It's funny how life can be so very serious
Hold your head up, don't let the light keep you away



It's a game now
It's a game
It's a game now
The way you play
It's a game now
It's a game
It's a control
It's a game now
It's a game
It's a one hit or three
It's a game or a three
It's the way you play
It's a game now
It's a game

It's a game!The sun will come out tomorrow
Bet the express is right
And my heart will beat out of me
Oh my heart

And I guess you'd say
One love should just fly away
And you would fool a lie
Oh my heart

I found the words
You never even tried
You fed aorus
You fed aorus
To my heart

The smile
That you gave to me
Like a kid in school
Couldn't even try
The smile
That you gave me
One look in her eyes
Couldn't believe what I saw
Was the world finally starting to see
Oh my heart is done
Oh my heart is done

The smile
That you gave to me
Like a kid in school
Couldn't even try
The smile
That you gave me
One look in her eyes
Couldn't believe what I saw
Was the world finally starting to see
Oh my heart is done
Oh my heart is done

And when I found the reasons
You were so afraid to fire
I told you
You tried to bury that voice in my heart
To convince me that we are as one
Oh my heart is done

Ain't looking for love, ain't seeing love
Wanna get away, ain't getting you
But your love is coming over me, ain't you heard of other girls?
Ain't worth it, ain't loving for this voodoo
Pretend that you ain't 'bout it, boy, ain't going nowhere

Let your guard down boy, you ain't gotta know your secret
Where, oh where, oh when, oh where can I find you
When I'm gone, I'm gonna be what you always want me to be
Let your guard down boy, you ain't gotta know your secret
Where, oh where, oh when, oh where can I find you
When I'm gone, I'm gonna be what you always want me to be

When I come through
I'm done being in love with you
You want me to run away, you won't come back broken
Don't wanna see you go, boy, you out of your mind

Ooh, ooh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Yeah, when I'm gone
I'm gonna be what you always want me to be
When I come through, when I come through
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Ooh, when I'm gone
I'm gonna be what you always want me to be
When I come throughWhen I wake up early in the morning
Heavy breathing and the air is thicker than before
Dragging your feet to the floor
I'm not okay because I'm trying so hard not to cry

Did you hear what I said before?
Did what I heard you say it to me?
We don't have to go nowhere now

Go faster then a bullet is slowing up
Go longer than a bond between us
We've been waiting all damn day to break
Yes I've been waiting all damn year to let it go
I've been waiting all damn year to let it go

I don't wanna wait anymore
Swear not to flare up
I know we've been talking for years
I don't wanna hold onto nothing
For I can only let it out and just let the flow
I've been waiting so long just to know if I can swim

Did you hear what I said before?
Did what I heard you say it to me?
We don't have to go nowhere now

Go faster then a bullet is slowing up
Go longer than a bond between us
We've been waiting all Damn, I've been waiting so years, its been going on girl
I've been waiting so long just to know if it's over
You've been waiting so long just to know if it's overThink I'd lie awake in bed for the weekend
Praying I wouldn't die from the light of day
Dreaming myself alive

Life on the grind
Making my money watching TV in the home
I like to pretend like everything is alright
Trying not to bruise the pride of the old me
Cuz I left all the memories of my boy on my wall

We in the home life
Picking up the phone
Making all the excuses that I make
Xans have to go and lengths to make it work
It's hard on me but I don't think it's necessary
Not at all!

Life on the grind
Making my money watching TV in the home
I like to pretend like everything is alright
Trying not to bruise the pride of the old me
Cuz I left all the memories of my boy on my wall

"I didn't mean to do this. I didn't say it. I didn't cross it. I didn't want to stay all along."

Think I'd lay awake in bed with a bone at my back
For the movies I'd lose my voice to empty words
Dreaming myself alive

Life on the grind
Making my money watching TV in the home
I like to pretend like everything is alright
Trying not to bruise the pride of the old me
Cuz I left all the memories of my boy on my wallThis heart of mine
That rams at your shoulder
touches my ear
sees the fear of the deep
Blue

And rams at the sea
breathes life eternal
and screams in the dark

I've looked high and low in the face of my
barbet
and in the heat of the fire
at the calling of the Lord
I've held my peace in the arms of love
and i have no fear

Waited long enough
I'm old and tired
to let you go
Waited to see your gaze
Waited to feel
your presence in me





I feel like a God
(I feel like a God)
I feel like a God
I feel like a God

There's a light inside
I found a secret place
In a dream I felt so right

Oh, my heart is yearning, it's burning

Oh, every night I'm praying, I really wanna go
Don't have the heart to tell you, just the passion
'Cause every night I look into Your armsWhat's the point of searching if
we never show
A selfistic miracle
Or a God who signed my name
ToNever show mercy on those who don't know the reason why
To never show mercy on those who don't know the reason why
What's the point of searching if
we never show
A selfistic miracle or
A God who signed my name
ToNever show mercy on those who don't know the reason why

Take all of this all I know
Feels like such an unbelievable situation

The sins that I commit pierce through my life
Endless being of mercy

Exprise is at the door of eternal life
With Christ who took away my pain

That the Son of God is here
Here beside me
It seems the faithless

So I don't backing down
The flood is here, hear the sound
And I lift up I feel, my will soar high
The God is here

Here He'll indeed come, Lord of Glory
Here In Your heartsFull Ghost:
So let my hope rise on this cursed death day.
Let my spirit soar like the wings of butterflies...
...and arise as the wings of butterflies...

For this cursed time we fly,
Reveal the beauty of ourselves,
So much else to be seen,
And be born as the wings of butterflies...

...and we die as butterflies...

...in Your thousand ways,
Still leaving loyalties,
So much to be said...
So let my hope rise on this cursed death day.
Let my feet fly,
And be the flying ghosts of butterflies...
...and we die as lonesome as lonesomes as lonesome as the lonesome wings lead lonesome as lonesome...
So let my hope rise on this cursed death day.
Let my hope rise on this cursed death day...
Let my hope rise on this cursed death day...
Let my hope rise on this cursed
death day.Falling into you
My life is sinking
Have you noticed?
You left me with nothing…
When you came into my life…
Now I don't know where else to go…
But you are my mood, so how can I not?

My life is sailing
Headed for the shore
And I don't know…
Who to blame?

Blame the time
Always changing my mind
Blame the time
Always changing my mind

All of my life
Is this much meant to me?
Why don't we go on living like we love!
Sometimes I start to doubt it all
All I know is you got to tell me it's alright!
Why don't we go on living like we love!

Let my hope rise on this cursed
 date with fate…
It's such a shame
Will you please me now
Cause I don't know how to live without you, babe!

My life is sailing
Headed for the shore
And I don't know…
Who to blame?

Blame the time
Always changing my mind

Why don't we go on living like we love!
Sometimes I start to doubt it all
But I know it

I'm not in love, but I'm in love with you
I can't wait 'til I take off this hat, 'til you know I mean you
You can all you wanna hear, but we cannot be that close, can't you see?
Baby, let me kiss you, so flawless and,
Baby, I can make you wet. shave your feet,

Grand baby
Little baby
Hello, hello

And it's they takein' a toll
Guess you could say I'm doing alright
It's 1 AM
Where do I go to count days
And what if you're there
And where do I know my name
If you lie
And what if you know my name

Wearin' out
They count the miles without the sunrise
As I rise above
Whom they mill their machines
And all them pray won't they find me here
If you know my name

The problem you see, the solution is everywhere
Try to hesitate boy, make your sign
But I want it
And I know your name
If you lie
And what if you know my name

I told you this before
I was right, you know, it's a lie
If you're not ready then I'll be too late
So why not lie?
And what if you lie?Yeah
Hey, I just filled out another post for you
(Another thread)

Oh, I must be fucking stupid lately
You know, I'm so stupid and I don't hit up girls
I met these sickos in the middle, we was taught to shut up
We had an emergency, we were trapped inside the car
Oh, maybe I should phone my friends
Maybe I should drink till I'm tired
Maybe I should fall asleep early
Tell them to bring our t shirts too
Or pick the girls up on Fridays
I called a cousin, he said "Hey,Pages in the flyer say"
I hope that this packs still arrives
I think I'll drink the bottles, now that's why they ain't in my cart
They said "Pap and eat" the next time I mention that
But it kills me that these girls aren't being honest
Maybe they should try our tips
So let's not waste time talking fast
Don't waste time talking fast
We should spend the night together, it still ain't got a slick touch

The motions won't stop
Cause you know the motion
Won't stop
Cause you know the motion
Won't stop
The motion
Won't stop
Cause you know the motion
Won't stop
The motion
Won't stop
The motion
Won't stop
The motion
Won't stop
The motion
Won't stop
The motion
Won't stopLay it all on my mind
So I can see
Thinking of you baby all day
I never back down
I go near where the train is going
Aaaaam
I gotta feeling good its hard to put it all on my mind
There's something that I can do
So I go to sleep
When I see your face
I can't deny the things we do
Ooh baby come on make love with me
I just want to make love with you girl
I just want to make love with you girl
Girl you are my life
You are my life
You are my life
Make love all the time
Make love all the time
Make love all the time
Make love all the time
Make love all the time

Lately I can't get enough
To keep from running dry
I want to let you know that
I'm not going anywhere
But then again who can I run against

Lay it all on my mind
So I can see
Thinking of you baby all day
I never back down
I go near where the train is going
Aaaaam
I gotta feeling good its hard to put it all on my mind
There's something that I can do
So I go to sleep
When I see your face
I can't deny the things we do
Ooh baby come on make love with me
I just want to make love with you girl
I just want to
 and bloodied love,
All the lies that we thought were gone.

And so you can put your wars in their place,
So you can see what we've been through.
And if you think it's funny,
Then take out some meaning.

And you can say what you want to see,
But if you think it's clever,
Then take it back to what you did before.

'Cause we will never know if we fight alone,
Your words don't mean shit to me,
I can't help but they're all the same:
That I've known all the time that we've been through.
That I've been waiting for a friend since you went away.
That I've been holding so tight, I'm so torn.
But I can't help but it's clear, I can't help but I like the lie.
But I can't help but I like the lie.

'Cause we will never know if we fight alone,
Your words don't mean shit to me,
I can't help but they're all the same:
That I've known all the time that we've been through.
That I've been waiting for a friend since you went away.
That I've been waiting for a friend since you went away.
That I've been waiting for a friend since you went away.
That I've been waiting for a friend since you went away.
Waiting for a friend like.

(Aye!)
My only nigga in my bum but he still laid yeah
(Can't whip me)
(I'm the only one)
(Aye!)
My only nigga in my bum but he still laid yeahIt's over but I'm not going home right now
Thought we had it figured out, now it's time to go
Let's get out and go do some living
But I don't wanna leave this place right now

Night reflects of the same ship but this time without you
 headed to the crossing to see a movie
Anotherblood starts the day, I'll be Clue but I won't say goodbye

Walking round aim, talkingaming but I can't see my way clear
Tris, T Cris, & DJ D. playing w affairs
Now I'm walking home the one I should've listened to
Outside, I ran outside to hide from the BOM beat
Crying on a rainy afternoon inatted these streets
'Bout to fall into the trams, underpasses, on streets
Tired of eating, riding, blowing, burning, pennies, bills, hating, seeing, driving in high cars
Tired of driving 40 at a time at the tips of theurs gliders in the amber of sorrow
Know my mind is a suit of smirk like I have on
Butta from a broken heart orgy from a fight at a liquor store
That'll blow a fuse when Im in heat, somebody pulling a gun
After the fight with the motortops, tip toeing

Gotta get away, It's a mild day! ( mild day!)
Pack your guns and try to blow this weed down the road and we said so
Among a certain select, i live for the broadway blues
That's my situation, young boss, young boss

Mac andro how we live and how we die
Win the reward or death or eternal humiliation
Through pomp and turncoats, to be the pen that i write
It's now or never, there's or hasn't been a clue
But i could play it safe, i'll walk out on my own

Because i'm tired of this
 your thoughts
I'm just a soul

Oh, I can't live without you
Oh, it would kill me to
Baby your touch won't me
Oh, can't live without you
Oh, it would kill me to
Baby your touch won't me

Now I'm so close to falling
But I've got so much more to do
Baby, is it too much to ask you?

Don't wake me now
I'm holding on to the hope I never get to sleep

It's not as hard as saying it's necessary
'Cause I'm dead serious, I don't want this business
As easy as fuck this motherfucker

Crazy, I'm about to fall in love with You
Got me dead serious,
Give me head like ropes in the bed
S-s-s-so it's facts to think
That I deserve this much for all of my days

Oh, I can't live without you

Oh, it would kill me to
Baby your touch won't me
Oh, can't live without you
Oh, it would kill me to
Baby your touch won't me

If I give love to a lover
Is it crazy how much you put in
Just to have him to slow me down?
Said you messed up a lot, that's a fact
But you aren't in love, aren't boyfriend
And all his women are just like you
They wanna be like you
Said you messed up a lot, that's a fact
But you aren't in love, aren't boyfriend
And all his women like you

Delicious, if I was neatly sorted
I wouldn't notice' suchetchingua
'Cause no matter what' I'm gonna find
Life's too short a sight to make focus
And I'm wasting now
Onicking younger and returning younger

Oh, I can't live without you

Did you sink me deep in vein?
Did you make me live without meaning?
Did you puke and throw up?
Did you reach for me?
As I shouted out for you
Please can I buy you time tonight?

Oh, I can't live without you
Oh, I can't live without you,
Oh, I can't live without you, oh
Oh, I can't live without you

Oh, I can't live without you
No, I can't live without youYou are at play
Staring at me
I've been waiting for you

You are atAim Before The flames of hell you came
Into the name of
Your perverseness I rose
Your wanton destruction
You were the one
who could bring me back to life

Your taste is what I drink away, you're like a red wine
I think about you now all the time
Your kind is what I need
I've grown so proud of myself
I wouldn't trade it for anything

You picked a gun and used it until you can
To shoot the hopes of those who are too far away
One hopes
Two fears
One false heaven
One heavy heart
One heavy heartStay with me,fore the storm
Until you say your last goodbye
I'll dream of your face
The light in the night that could fill the skies
I'll dream of you smile
The thrill of the rush
I'll rush down to you

Skin to skin
How deep could you go
Until it gets you into the ground
Keep your head up in the clouds
But I'll keep you safe right here in the water

Oh, kiss me when I stay (with you tonight)
Shut my eyes and swallow my heart (take me there)
Let the kiss air out through my soul (let it out tonight)

I'll dream of your face
The light in the night that could fill the skies
That could fill the skies
I dream of your smile
The thrill of the rush
I dream of the rush
I dream of the rush of air out through my soul
I'll keep your head up in the clouds
The wind could take but not hold you back
And I'll be waiting here

With my love for you
That would lift you up
I'd stand here lonely
From all the tears that you've cried

If only for another try
I'll be the one to buy, so thank you
 drop down to the floor
Now that I can fly
I'll become the last one
Watching over the world

As you speak is all you hear
Over the world
As you speak is all you hear
Over the world
Over the worldAs the sun goes dim
at midnight in London
a ragged band
talks Moet their tsugi
usingband off to their city
rebel messiahs
rejecting their religion
History
 in the air
'Cause I don't wanna hear no more
You said everything will be fine
If you want to I can say yes
So I'm just gonna say

We'll do anything we want
Spend the rest of my days in the dark
'Cause baby I don't wanna fade away
We'll stay the same, we'll stay the same
And I'll hold your hand through it all
I don't wanna fade away
I'm just gonna say

I'm just gonna say
I'm just gonna say
I'm just gonna say
I'm just gonna sayShe said "I'm a freestyleer than you"
Said "I'm a half of the character thatPinocchio was
Standing in the middle"

She said "Why would you want to stay stuck?"
"If you're not ready to risk it"
"It's okay, man, if you wait"

She slap me across the head
She said "Rob her again, you know I'm a stripeew match
Not knowing where her eyes were from"

She slap me across the head
She said "Rob her again, you know I'm a stripeew match
Not knowing where her eyes were from"
She slap me across the head
She said "Rob her again, you know I'm a stripeew match
Never knowing where her eyes were from"

Chorus: To all my friends
Long gone, gone the future is calling

Verse 2:
Pinocchio had a dream
But was really awake with a bowl of fire in his eyes
He kept a smile on his face for his wife
Cos when they gathered 'by god I did say
Why yes when you should go to the pyre

Chorus: To all my friends
Long gone, gone the future is calling

When you should go to the pyre
 pyre.I got way too many ghosts
They're not ghosts
I'm not bigger than them
I don't think that I shoulda
I think I shoulda, baby

I get so embarrassed when they say the mouth feels like it just began to
Burning, burning, building up my name like a Who's Under Cardgage?
That's some pressure, that's some powder
I can or should be scared of children
They tell me all the time, my heart is on the hurr
But no hits, no beauty, no this ain't a fumble
I think it's funny when you come back to me
Like it's some pressure, lightning in a bottle like Cheech
And look at what I finally found, in this fuck-up
I'm cracked and it hurts, this love is overrated
I could put up a wall, all my dreams are on ice
Only find you high in the red, next stop
Is your mother, who told you

I got way too many ghosts
They're not ghosts
I'm not bigger than them
I don't think that I shoulda
I think I shoulda, baby

(All on)
I got way too many ghosts
(All on)
Way too many ghosts
(All on)
I'm not bigger than them
(All on)
Right in front of you
Looking like this, every disease
Face to face, roll this shit over
I really wanna see you roll this shit
What kind of gang kindaeries roll this shit?
What kind of gang kindaeries roll this shit?
What kind of gang kindaeries roll this shit?
What kind of gang kindaeries roll this shit?
It's them only rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin
 gangsta blood brothers roll this shit
We all rollin, rollin, rollin, rollin
 violence rang out, shattered glass Crippin rolled this shit
Wrong side of town, Crippin Ric Nation roll this

And you know I'm not going away.

I’m all that gets me mad
Really got my money and chips on my mullet again
And I do it without jheeze, hates me and pics
He be talking all that stress but is notOr for once, you know, I won't be out in this street
I'll lay it down for you, I'll ride it on for you
Another one, it might be the night
It's gonna be, it's going to be hard
For you and all your friends, to get along without no clothes
It will be, it's going to be hard

Out on my own, in the rain
I don't wanna be nobody else
Out on my own, in the rain
I don't wanna be nobody else

Keep it G, keep it positive
Gotta know where I'm headed
So I keep myself self-assurance

Or it might be the night if you need that
Or it'sTaking on the world is too much, too fast
Yeah
And you wonder why people give a damn
Why people care what people think

People say what's on their mind
People say what's on their minds
But none of them ever question my wisdom
Some don't respect that
We all got a voice, there's no debate
It's in the air all the time

People think I'm interesting
Just a satellite of the world
But you don't

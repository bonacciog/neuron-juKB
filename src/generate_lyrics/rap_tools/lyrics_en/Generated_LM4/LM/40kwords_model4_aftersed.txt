And when you're alone I'm free 
Also when you love her, whatever is meant to be 
But never invented you 
With anything I'll never smile from no other 
Just roll with me 
I will leave you all alone 
(If you do promise me) 
Oh! (Just don't let me drown) 
Don't let me down 
Don't let me down', ooh 
We will meet strangers, it's not real 

So right, too 

You say it's so hard to move on 
And you told me all that you've done 
But that was the end, you made a mistake 

Though I always think of you lost 
Before you just let it go 
You said you'd never fall asleep 

And now my heart might view the way you had 
I've never been so sick of you 
Falling from heaven, took my tears down if you were my one 
Saying that I was with you 
And now I'm a victim of feelings that was never done 
Told me I was unlucky 
Fell into your presence 
They said that you'd remember me 
I was, I did, I couldn't give up 

To myself, but I can't go back 
Where the things are supposed to be 
What's just left once, favorite things 
We knew all about 
I could've crashed on you 
'Cause I felt so sad 
I'd leave when I was screaming 
Oh, then wha-man, when the walls would collapse 
In the past just turns the page 
What a waste of time 
It's all we need's a life 
Between the lines and how you do, how much I lose that you 
Were all the same 

Then again, and again 
There's an scratches on my door, I felt like we're connected again 
You know 

We're waiting for your love to come undone 
Oh, you know I'm all alone 
But we know, come back to make our way back home 

We got on the tip of my tongue 
You got my bed, you got my head 
You got I got your foot on my waist 
I got my bags packed up in the dirt 
You got structure, you put a mess on me 
You got me in every habit 

Ayy, Alimbae, majle, alai 
SABDANNY NANNIMENE 

I got hairy disgrace 
Blab on my back, B 
Across the mountains 
I heard your weeping 
Give me blessings 
Dive into my heart 

Won't you call my name 
I caught you lying with a devil 
Standing in your bed looking for ways 
A little mess of what you wanna 
I had given you one love 
I'm not tryna be here 

I was your victim when living break 
Your fear was never enough, yeah 
Cover you up between your dreams 
And I'm a slave 

Just go ahead and say 
What it is, I'll hurt you, that's what I call you 
If it makes you proud 

What are you waiting for? 
What have you done? 
What have you done? 
What do you care? 
What are you waiting for? 

Here the world has come 
Too much to fight 
All they say's is not too critical 
So tell me lies 

Don't know when these things start to show 
You're the another one who left the bed 
Can't deal with all your might 
As times get so bad 
So know it'll be by the way 

Ohh 
So easily 

I can't control the way I'm holding on to this 
Baby I'm losing moonshine 
And I cannot wait to say good-bye 
But if it's wrong 

I wanna be everything you want 
'Less you come tonight with me 
I wanna be where you are 
I wanna be with you tonight 
Everyday rah, ah-ah 
Feels like I'm perfect 
I'm feeling so good honest, you can't give it up 

Now Yeah 
How the hell am I 
You're here? 
When I lost you 
Jason online just because you had me stuck in the middle of the night 
You make me feel so fine 
And when you look i'm knife you leave me inside 
Don't mess around matter of time showing me the hurt I uncover 
To seasons waste all my time 
Don't tell me I should try to belive you girl 
Tell me no 
Tell me where no one's gonna go 
Tell me why you gotta stay the same 
I'm standing here inside 
Just don't say you need me 
No I don't wanna say 
No you really don't wanna vibe 
Wanna cause that you come from me 
Too many times ago, 
Maybe 
You tell me 
You can't believe in me anymore 
I'm sorry, sorry for all 

I wanna be on the way 

Do you wanna fool 
I wanna heal 
I wanna leave 
So I can keep on spending 

This is the end my friend 
This is my life 
It's the game that I'm missing 
Save me now can you get me through the night 
This is the last time 
This is the last time to find my last breath 
This is the last time 
Iâ€™ve kissed you and fell in love 
Right now 
It was kill me 
I've never fallen from the ground 

It doesn't seem to fix nothing 
I'm not moving anymore 
Now I've never said no 

You're someone new 
So girl you live like you did 
And I don't wanna love you anymore 
I don't wanna hurt you no more2AM on the bed looking and always talking 
Got nothing to say about 

I've hung up above ya 
Saying I'm on this spot anymore 
I never felt so sure 
Traffically that I forgot her in it 
Rock up the room in public 
Ouh save you with her 

Running from limbo 
All my friends I didn't matter 
I've been changing the whole night 
Walking the world of the New Orleans 
Too busy breaking all my sounds 
Can't remember why I doubt the pain 
All these faults and these empty walls ever stop 

So those special memories we made up on our dreams 
And if we make arrangements we don't be at home 

Bad habits life, baby 

For one more chance to look back 
Would be shy getting in your way 
And I know I'm scared to look through 
The weather it'll tear us apart 
Cos you've gave it all to someone 

And we'll be playing 
And we know 
We can talk about it 
If we work it out 
When it ain't nobody play us 

Hey, why do you play with me 
Why do you play with curious 
Sex with me and my squad and your name for 

(Rah) 

Hey "mother, Oh Deving" 

We crazy kinda crazy for the thrill of it 
We want the real love 
Bibia love how painful it gets 
Baby problem playin' it every song about love 

Hey baby, don't go judge it 
crossroads, f--ah in your mind 
Oh I, I love it when we kiss 
When you walk in the room 
And them are the dreams 
And I love you but you hide behind my heart (take you right) 
Can we break it out? 
(Can we ride it all away, one more time) 

All I'm hearing is hopes for life and drivin' 
All your stars and spells are burning 
All the people that hurt you with smoke to billionaire 
It's all the thrill of time your lips can hear you 

Will it even matter? 
You're so sly and lost and lonely 
Make you feel so happy 
Shed a little light to guide you home 

If you really want to live that way 
Pray it won't take you away 
Let's be gone tonight 
Don't you want to be afraid of it?Climbing bodies on the fumes tin of draw, letting go 
Life can't last forever, all I want is a slice 
And I needed air and the doubters for photographs 
This could be all right 
This is now we've grown till waterfalls and seeds of destiny 
You gave me time for all of us to lose the way that humans make me feel 
I let myself say I ever think of the rain 
I would've told ya, I believed that I had used to 
That you thought you're patient, could've missed the one I wished you would 
For years you're settling for me, so I can't wait at these other times 
So if ever at the end of the, it's a final day 
Living a lie, for a lonely day 

Oh indecisioned, from coloured thin teeth 
Of all those silence, and plans that never meant to say 
I give you nothing but big tears and near me in wildness 

The bitter fucking words I never told you 
In fact that they said goodbye 
I spent this symbol of myself that trying to earn the fight 
I let go of being restrained 
I'll see it's gravity, the sleeplessness rain 
and a vision of endless countryside 
(In a tidal wave, it's a storm; I will hold you in my life) 

Well broken and broken is falling apart 
Still burning me deep and this I'm bleeding out 
I'm fighting for myself 
Now you, you've taken away 
Because you won't let go 
I'll keep faith, save all your scars 
All of the pieces you'll be 

(You're gravity) 
Above this hole we will see the ending 

The way that you flip that line 
Here I go back to the things we've said 
I believe I'll make this day 

I can tell that you can't live without me 
Keeping us together 
What is wrong with being what we can't be 
What was this Earth keeps on trying, our ain't more than 
What our words will ever be 
Cause your mother, tell me what we're fighting for 

Another another night in the alleyway 
Down the road I pray for it 
The future reveal its fading 
I will answer 
The screaming of this foe umbillian 
I finally let this pass me by 
Great father 
I hear these memories 
Will he follow me as my God sleeps 
Too many empty seas 
The destiny shattered, I pray 
The comfort whipping size 
The rage I'll be heavy 
I want to see what's coming 
I know, The poet already breaks 
The Son and conquest the lied 
And I know You can't understand from me 
Got my heart on my sleeve 
A Endless mercy 
I'm living life for the fearless and the resistance 
And my soul waits, I've come to this land 
This is how the hate goes 
Oh ooh this love is a prison lake 
Whaddideon Can see Your love shine 
Forever a god grows in (Fisa) 
My love will bring Your name 
HEAR YOU! 

Found my smile to your face 
You was a glitch on the wall 
Your mission was just a captivated 
This is my call 

This is my time advice now 
Still this little you won't have to fight this 
I am no stronger yet 
Worries all on my chest 
I'm a violence I try not to grow 
I wish that I could tell you 
What could happened so 
It's now or never 
From the distance to my cuts before it's light 
Here we are again 
I'm hiding from believin' my pride and pride is all 
When it can seem real, yeah it's a dream or truth 
My heart calls out again 
And I wish you decides 
Until I reach out to the sky above 
To lift my voice to carry on 
I feel I'm in your hands 
In that hole in my soul 
In my secret times 
In the warmth of my soul 

I must believe this world could help me carry on 
I hope that it won't stop until you come back 
I can't find the strength to carry on to world 
And the hole of my soul 
Can't be envious if it won't go away 

My circuits screaming 
Please don't let go of my wounds 
Please don't go 
So lets leave unsaid 
Believe you lost the choice 
My life is all wandered away 
Breathe in this hole 

Sons of the day, I'm certain of you 
Dangerously in life in your hearts 
Monarch of death and loneliness 
Drowned my words inside your heart 
Drain the darkest part of lights 
I drown in the darkness we lost 
We let go of our hearts 

We call upon you and all that you adore 
InmashesRoyal is asleep 
Of all this around 
And before you grow colder 
The chips are up 

My stomach is windered 
All in buying a man I am painting off into 
How far will I go 
Little freak dogs' elaces 
I am indeed 
A man who starts devouring 
A lot to consume 
In an adolescent 
No signs of violence 
Have you got it all? 
In the desperate company 
That didn't feel his way 
It's the wind that fills its head 

But not the ambitions of deliverance 
Has pushed us down 
Behind my prison door shut 
Something for 31 has passed the day, I 

Just unbearably white 

What is my worth? 
What is my name? 
I'm not myself anymore 
Not just a liquor dream 
I am a giant soul 
Almost a sailor, 
That's no born for me 
Living a war 
For a victory 
Eca 

repetition, I can't ignore this 
hate is the colour of a armor 
traded rives in a battery full of poison 
He demands a brand new demise 
Now in this room 
I know she's sorry 
Still I feel alive 
I love the way it (?If you go along 
I can take away all the sadness away 
If you walk right through me 
You could tell me where to be 
Pouring off to the chord 
To tell you the truth 

Here dawns a natural life, alone since he was pure 
He was in a landslide, but saw her smile 
Staring across the heavens 
Finally my hereI wanna stop 
Only you can drive me crazy 
From you 
Loching, you dont wanna stop 
Can't quit 
I wanna stop you from sleep all night 
Making me happy 
These are all my love 
I wanna keep you faithful 
Fill my heart with love 
With my heart I wanna leave 

I'm never gonna leave this bed 
And I'm yours to get so much better 
They say my love is jaloing 
But a sweet show going crazy 

(Crawling free) the drugs you got inside me 

(Come on now) 
Try me in line (come on and stop me) 
'Cause I'm a supersonic woman 
I need it if no lovin' was enough 
To take me away 
I'm a get it long for you, my lover, babe 
(Wasn't yours at all) 

I promise you I would not 
You promised me all day 
You make me forget 
Make more than what you give, what you take 
Andante, Andante 
On a wire, you're a strong mistake 

Playin' the game, checking what been gettin' it girl 
They don't teach you how To be a star (Oh, oh) 
The way you're supposed to scflowing out through the roof 
Total G-A-(Sopth) Love to make it brand new 
(Love) You've been travelin' only for one 
(Open up) 
We don't know what the future holds 

It's 
Gonna run you away 
They can't run from you 
They'll run you through 
'Cause I know that you feel free 
No place you'll never change, baby 
Ain't nobody else to love you 
Make them say a key 

Everything that you doIt's painful always worse than I hadn't, better, â€¦Let's go astray, make the firdes her believer 
Maa hohoos, hun best foreign to me 
As long as we can if not please, way 
I've could left angel now, make her know me 
And if i love some leaf, for some free 
Patti packed the Rolls and a sketchy pain 

They dinosaurs eight, the cab of bacon 
Takin it and ducked insurdoted characteries. 
Scratch and shut and get lost in some dumpked urans 
Summoned in comparizans like Urpiton's biscuit, like giggory 
When B's, like "Dolla hopt" 

It might hurt 21 friends like she's "solo) 
Rocking up the steps in his bag pumpin', singing Badhna 
Then blisters at the front and the jeans just party a little guy 
Might as well run around a few the lunch angels and there ain't no man out there 
Gonna put the police one behind a stage for everyone 
But I dont careload feelings, Oprah, choop, hold on 
Welling, do what I'm imite, that's true 
See I fuck with hoes, with skrd-a-orky 
Yo, they won't take on the bitch 
Get that ass on it want four bucks II 
Guttin' that motherfucker in me frame, Ken sang a little oil of that bag 
I'mma make you wait 'til I pass me by doctor's litorSo I stay off 
Tomorrow's still 
Can't believe it 
Indulpai... 
You can't stay all the way to make one smile 
You're right and to the other side 
But I just won't live what you like it to do 
I don't care if nobody else believes 

When I smash, I fly 
I am dead in GLalin's bar 
Give you your wings for me 
Girl, it's in the blood 
You wanna be moggin me all day 
Don't wanna be smarter 
Hey, I want you better 
Full of cheese 

Let's make some of a cakeI'm gonna change it while I get this thing 
So, never gonna let me go 

'Cause I won't give up, I won't give up 
Oh, never give up, I won't give up 
Oh, no, I won't give up, I won't give up 
I won't give up, I won't give up 

Well oh, I didn't give up the dirt 
You couldn't give my trust, you couldn't even understand 
What I'll never have to say 
That's all I wanted, yeah 

They're all who I really want to be, yeah 
All lined up with a diamond face 
In my mind 
They're never gonna set me free 
Yeah, but I'm faded, yeah I'm lonely and alone 
And I know they can cut the mold 
But you can count on me 
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah 

Talking loud, on my heart 
Talking in the street 
Throwing down my paper 
Putting up my phone 
Scared to be yours 

Maybe 'cause I don't care 
When I'm with my friends 
"Am I gonna do something, I'm here?" 
Telling myself you ain't gonna move, yeah 
â€˜Cause if your stupid smile is your hair 
I'll try and turn in 
If you ain't 'bout a job with your friends 
'Cause if you'll stay a while, ain't there a way 

If I could talk a little bit more 
I wouldn't matter, would you? 
Or the way you look at me 
I don't want to be with you 
I'm a beautiful old-fashioned girl 

If I was stuck in a quiet room 
I wouldn't bother for how it used to go 
And I don't think he'd understand 
She's right and fine 

So let me take you out of this town 
Or waste your time my time 
So when you turn back the things you see 
Still seem to float by... 

Honey, if you know i'll hold you before you pull it out 
You tell me if you want me to 
So boy, don't you give yourself a try now 
Try in my arms till you're the sky 

Please, come out here tonight 
Come on, let's just take the breath away 

I want you tonight 
Come on baby Come sa tonight with me tonight 
Just tonight I will give you my heart to fire 
I would give you all my love in the dark 
Come on over and dance with me 
I won't forget that right in front of me, yeah 

Dancing in the night 

Just say you will not stop 
The sun is burned 
The sun won't come down 
Honey, I'll keep you burning 
Keep it burning 
I can't wait to give you up 
I won't stop baby now 

The night is gone 
I will guide you home for me 
Just when I wanna 
Fulfill your love 
I will keep you here 
When you come close to me 

I will be there, you belong 
(You will come be there) 
I will be there 
I will be waiting 
I will be there tonight 

Sunrise all alone by now 
We are waiting for the water to end 
Resurgending, I won't remember to survive 
(Nah, oh nah, yea-yea-yeah, Uh hadat) 

'Cause I'm not going to break you 
No, I still can't wait to hold you 
I feel so you always want me back! 

Hey, I am that dress, go and leave behind 
Hey, don't hide, don't let go 
You can leave your mindI just can't get enough of your love 
It won't get much sweeter 
I don't know my therapist he's got it 
Don't go times can lead on a lonely ride 
(Can't take my time, my time}Hey little mama, you need to see, my dear 
I know what you're doing, Grace, games, pearl 
I hope you're scared to hide, oh for anything 
There's so many different reasons just that someone that I love 
Oh oh oh, 
baby, they're too much to take away my pride 

All I wanna do is touch ya 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh, 
oh oh oh 
I can't get you off my mind, oh 
All I, all I ever wanted is someone to see! 
I maintain the chords and control the key 
And all I ever need's a piece of Tina 
Oh I'm washed and disaster, I don't know no English 

I'm flying up, i'm ready for summer 
I'm walking, grab my wheel 
I'm razor in the clouds with a burning flame 
And I'm diving into the deep end 
I'm looking for a love like a hole in the sky 

And I should smile for a while 
But my feet are swallowing my ears 
I'm demands to be dug 
And so when I'm stuck in my homies trying to rhyme 
Surely a girl, and I'm watching the night 
Like I'm everywhere, so I can present 
I'm close and my heart starts pumpin' 
I'm never gonna break my heart 
But it's a love robbery 

She oughtta give some fuck 
Never gonna buy the telephone 
Never change a thing or more 
Wait, I'm never gonna hold my tongue 

Long hair before she hits my wrist 

Got a new appointment 
Super champagne fundasity 
Got her top dishes 
Guess she's a blessing 
She burn wild 
No form of fame 
Chasing down a good time 

He so happy, that's my face 
I feel sure when we're uncomfortable 
And shareworking 

Food is getting puiling around 
I want my sister full like, we're sixteen jobs now 
And then I sit on the couch 
I remember the bed Pot off her couch 

A kind of girl that gets me so mad I know it 
I feel like an evil woman 
In a West Texas where it leads in a Detroit ting, around 
With a broken woman who knows the way kids play 
Like Meek Havey with every voice, I just ask for a name 
I hope she cry what we say, whatever will happen, 

Baby, tell me where the hell I go I know that I'm proper 
Is it somethin' I want, when I'm fucked up 
Cuz I wanna know when I'm through 
Don't tell me 'bout my love thing 
'Cause I wanna love a good thing they're all real 

I wanna know what's behind me, but it ain't gotta be 
Hey, girl, I'll just try to fit into you with much to lose 
I wanna make it right with you 
Like I think about you sometimes with me 

And I don't wanna hear you calling, I don't wanna 
â€˜Cause you're the only one that I'd be coming for 

Tell me, tell me that you'll be my one 
Shut up, shut up and smile when I'm with you 
No way, no way, no way that it'll be better 
These ooseless feelings with head up in my shoulder 
Baby, baby ain't you scared of the things we see 
Well, come sit your sleeves to my feet 
Cause they'll tell you how I'm lookin' into my field 
And I'm gon' tell you everything, when we're through 
'Cuz we're through you when I die, you're okay 
I could touch you after the night 

So tell me about you, ain't no rush 
And tell me there's no things that love 
And I'd got no place to go 
Just at your feet, in my skin 
'Cause you're the only one I'll ever be 
Holding me when I holdin' my body (when you talk) 
When I'm with you, there's no time for us tonight (Come on baby) 

Baby got me tripping 

You stay right now 
As bitter as I touch you, then you leave 
And I've done enough 
To put off the landslide 
'Cause you're one of the good ones 

'Cause we've been gettin' sneaky 
You get what you get 
I know you don't get enough 
This shit a movie with a vest 
I know that you changed a couple of kids 
But I just wanna hear your voice 
I don't wanna hear your voice 
Oh! 

â€˜Cause every beauty has lost time, too 
As far as comes 
But my remorse, the time keep on haunting 
While I'm holding your head from 9 to 5, never dried 

I never told you long-provoked for the last time, I think I lied 
We won't let the pain say so 
So write my story from crying 'cause my face heard 
Am I retired? Now somethings they whispered at me 

I'm trying to convince myself 
So I travel by the pain I hold 
I forget to kiss 
still. 

Turn off the lights, let the world move 
Turn it all around 
Let it all out 

It's all gonna take you 
The love that you hold 
Your life 
It haunts me when it hurts 
You're in 
It all tiltedLook at you lying in the morning 
Feel like you're dancing on the neon rays 
Shining down on you 
You look like a dream just to come along 
You don't know how much I love you 

Baby don't you know I'm still high 
You don't know me like I do 
Cause I'm so hard baby up at you 
And there's nowhere to hide 
True love never stops 
But you're still my baby 
You never know 

You know I'm back at the door 
To the train cause I was born 
But you never call me 
You haven't called me a friend for someone like you 

I hate my heart that you break my heart 
I say love will never know 
But I'm waiting the long way home 
I love you every single day 
And you make me feel the same 

The darkness was up just to say 
Just hit me when you were me, oh yeah 

Just give me a sign you got to give away 

"Shut up, darling, shut up, shut up 
I'll be sick of trying to tame this over 
What you've done to me? 
Fix up, get up, call me, get up, give up 
Get up, I'm going 
Cause I'm not gone 

When you fight 
I know it's hard to believe 
I tried so hard 
Why don't they leave me? 

I try 
When I hear you 

Will he even walk away 
Or will I look in 
No matter how hard I try 

Will someone else 
Will anybody take it away, yeah? 

I'm waiting 
For you 

Sometimes I feel like giving you 
Even when I love you 
I feel like I'm lostWalking down this long road. 
And I don't know where I'm going. 
I don't wanna be my home. 

Darlin' can you promise that I will turn the next on me. 
You're the best thing I've ever had 
And I don't know where the story ends, 

And when they see me I'm a drift! 

We can do it just so little 
(we're going to be rough, but they're ruined it up) 
(ah ah) When we do something great 
"We're going to Graceland 
'Cause you've changed your mind 
And brought your anermy. 
I will hold off your pretty hands and all of our lives go home in time 

So alright, you've lived my life 
I've loved like a teardrop in your hair 
Let me take you there 
And take our freedom, take our time 
Earing you with me again 
I'm sorry you dont have to 
Freedom more 
And we will have it all 
Goodbye 

(It must have been like) 
We've been searching so and done. 
Our love has lost all of us, granted then we're dying (ooh..) 
So don't walk away 
We'll find in yesterday 
And we'll bet it all 
Relieve your comship' in your heart 
To take you away 
You'll never open your mind 
We'll never stay away from love if we promise 
To feed you our 
When we see destruction fade 
We've no place to hide 
It's not yet to pass us by 
And you'll be coming to way 
Yeah you'll never know 
Where I am now 
I'll never be alone (never let go) 
We'll be here till our days flood (our lives) 
I'll always be there and I am all alone 
I'm just floating in the dark 
'Till you hear the sound 
Of the light of the dark 
The light of my life 
The light of the moonOnce I was broke, lost pictures, feel the things I didn't flinch 
I can't trust you, now, I, I love you so 
And don't got a heart killing me but I still feel when I fight what I need now. 
I walk a line for your love when I see you. 
You were leaving for a rainy day 
The only thing you'd think of me 
Is here to be right here with me, 
I know you've left my eyes without a trace of a trace 
And I must have known this girl, I will tell you more 
I haven't found my way, 
I go my way 

Why did I leave my heart right, 
(left my heart behind) 
Far from the middle of a bottle of wine 
(I had a heart of steel in a box) 
Yes, I went stung my heart, erased nothing fast 
So I must be believing, 
I'd like to go home (but I couldn't let him go) 

I have to be alone 
(I have to be, I have to be alone) 
I have to be alone, Broadway glead! 

I have been here before 
I have a memory. 
And you can't explain, you will 
What's on my mind? 
Why can't you do me wrong. 
How can I make you happy, yeah 
Do you thought I could be myself and you aren't understood? 
My one is down, on the one you love 
I love rock 'n' roll high 

[There, right next to bronca to experiment? 
Going to walk on, was my foot up and I killed, the video that 
I trying to get my backbone up and their horn on 

I had some sleep enough into white, ah, ah, a-h 

My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I got to stay right 
And my past is almost dead, I'm alive and I'm still alive 
It was that I was born, I was raised to be blind 
I'm living like a man, I'm alive 

I'm fooling home, everyone knows that I'm about to fly 
While I go to sleep in the middle of the night 
Ain't going nowhere, ain't goin' home 
I'm goin' crazy, I ain't goin' homeI hope you understand 
That you can just breathe without a sound 
Now all you talk, just listen 

Just remember, to feel you alive 
But now, overlook this life 
And go right there 
At least everything is shattered 
I'd give them lies to me, you'd give your life to me 
Imagine me 
If we could 
If we ever meant to 

If you knew, would you live like loving me? 
If you don't if you dreamed of me 
When you didn't tell 'em, what you want in me 
Would you ever give in 
Instead of now that you're here and I'm happy 
Cause you really forgot everything 

But, I don't wanna close the door 
I don't wanna burden 
Every time I watch the pain turn to dust 
Don't wish that death could take us away 

'Cause I pass and I take to heal 
Do you feel the same 
When the fire dies 
With eyes above 
Upon the sand sands in the water? 
While I see no evil clearer 
I know it's in our midst 
The way we could not be 

I just wanna scream like you 
But the mirror carries 
Before I feel the same way I'm spinning 
So take the breath step into my hands 
I can feel your love in my palms 
I could feel your fingerWrap my Easter view; love was rare 
All said that I'm given, for the progress I show 
But it's time I take a ride off, dancing on a train 
Even with the fog and the dawn love I lost 

I hear people can't get me 
Gotta get my kiss moving from your neck 
I feel who we used to kiss 
'cause it doesn't seem right 
And I can't even lie, we can't walk away 
I'm done with the pain you gave 
And I'd still be young and I'm scared 
When it's all right 
I can't go to sleep but no one's exposed 
So I'm prepared to 
Just turn around 
And tell me, what the underdog 
Promise for this won't be alright 
We are too young to take an oath 
Too meeting nothing if I have to 
And we could never be surprised 

Sweet lady hold me tight 

Yeah 

And I'm thinking about you 
I'm leaving 
I need you to have some fun 
I'm made of stone 
With your lipstick on 
And I ain't wasting time 
I gotta even ball 
Boy, you ain't got my money 
What so long 
To give up at my friends 
I'm off my sleeve, I feel 
I'm half hard on my own 
'Cause I'm hoping that it might smile 
But you're stealing my love 
All these dirty cups 
I'm hopin' that you're here with me 

Baby I'm 
With you in my life 
In my heartGreedy fussin through the streets 
Adchrist and raised 
Compared my time 
Part is right 
Months a spark 
Sword in the trigger tonight 

This is all I need 
The way my life is 
But we choose 
Faith in your eyes 
I'm desperate 
But have nothing left for me 

Nothing at all 
Just crying 
'Cause I am all alone 
One step 
One and one 
One 
Left 
One wrong walk 
One flesh 
One plus one 
Jesus 
One niThought we felt the most 
You were in my jeans 
You marched to the moon 
I cried the fear, we prayed 
We did no harm before 
I used to play the games of me 

Do you remember how I feel about you now 
Got you diggin' my corses'place and call the morning 
Letting your amor tell me whence 

Put me on a box 
My body is on fire 
Drawing me under 
Take my love, you know 

Get it off, get it, get it 
What's your love, what's your name? 
No need to worry 'bout it 
Open your mind 'cause you won't see 
Your love, my love, your love, to love 
Your body, your love, your love 
Your love, your love, your love 
Come on, come on, come on, come on 

'Cause you are the one 
Who breaks the Sun 
For me it's not enough 
It's my heart for one 

Master 

Don't close my eyes 
We are undercover watching the sky unite 
Take my heart and follow 
Take the 
digits for with the sweetest high, a scar 
You are so F-Ou, I'm like 
Robillow, chess, eating out and I'm loose 

Baby, please don't want to leave 
Please don't give me back 
Baby, don't go 
And you're so lonely, poison, girl you need 
Now you got me On 
Tell me where you been 

I wanna make you mine 
Baby, you, know, I know in time I know 
You're the feeling I'm with red 
And I'm back to love again, oh babe 
And I'm starting from the one you love 

I'm so free 
And I'm so fastOur emotions are like fun on the table and 
Acting like we should 
Lose our patience outâ€”come to this party 
Let's get phat 

We all got laughter on our own 
We think life is just a dreamIntimidaira.no.

And if you didn't want me see 
Then you pulled my suitcase 
To break me 

You would be waiting 
But you could be here tonight 
Have a second chance to called you again 
It really must be time 

360 the last vas an imgrau 
Mixed with while I playing tricks & beer 
I'd play my fault) I sit and think of you in a second 
And I made the work you did to get to be loud 
You don't see me hangin' out the hillside 
So rest my bones and like some cyanide 

You pocket swelsean 
And they rubbed you in the mouth 
Yeah, you even love them with many timescraft 
Forced for Movers, oh, oh, yeah 

And we don't wanna talk itIn the afternoon, I know it 
(Oh, tell me) 

Car shining, cloud floor 
Got about room the travel 

Let me show you where to go, how I could give ya 
Just one second, it'll all pass 
I'ma take the time I wanna show you a Guide 
Me and my niggas in a jar like Jaara 
Buy my jacket across your back, baby 
'Round the unholy risk on 
You know flavor said my name 
I hit touch some licks 
Oh baby, I despise ya cryin' now 
I'm all wrapped up, I'm a man with a man 
With my words and my brain 
You can spend time with a hip-hop dude 
Seek and just relaxed and chill, but trust her 
If I leave you for dead it'll get you look behind 
All my life of such an ignorant wickedness 
I do it to these people 
I never thought I'd call your name 
I hate how we attained 
For a doubt when I part of you 
I'm happy that I'll never forgive you good 
Put it in your mouth forever and point for a hand, my mind is 
The time you go through 
Do you like the way I sit till you stay at all? yeah 

I wake up hurting the talk around my face 
Will you ever win? How did I miss you? 
I need to Now 'bout real. 
Sorry was real different? 

Broken hearts be on the line 
Looking for the words inside you 
Running things too deep on me 
Tell it to my heart 
But I don't really know what to say 
when you look at the doubts I'm feeling 
I think we both said ever again 

Getting over the way to say I wanna feel like all your rest 
I could just wait for you 
Cause I know that you love me 
And you don't even care 

And I'm sure he won't let me hurt 
But just one day I will need you to miss me 
Spend everything I hoped he'd never said 
And now that I'm all alone 
'Cause I am hoping hard to reach you 
Cause giving you all I had 
To keep you from crying 

pass me by the time 
Baby you said you were right 
You know the truth 
Something in me 
Made the special mistake 
And I will embrace it 
Your teasing 
He wont ever of me 
Just as long as we both know 

Ever since you were with me 
You were my direction 
You were my light 
You were my sun 
The stars were bright 
You were my sunshine 
You are my star in my life 
We were meant to be 
So damn broken 
And we were never so perfect 

Said I'd do anything for you 
But I would never do that 
Never knew you would ever do that 
Never meant to play this song for you 
But still I do but I never had to learn the lesson 
I wont forget how 
You why? 
So I can't forget you tomorrow, much 
That was always enough 
To terminate my mind 
But I can't stand with you 
No matter what I do it I'm on my way 
So strong 
I wish you had stayed 
I wish she knew that that I would never never, ever 
Bro, told me I drive you crazy 
And I hope you understand the pain in you just can! 
In my foolish lover's dream. 

Time to take that moment 
Time to put on every show 
Time to tell you there's something wrong without you 

I'm as lost without you I'm lost in the fire (fire), ongoodbye me Can't erase the fact that it would last don't make my face come true 
Touching in my soul 
I'm out of my mind 
If you want me to 
I don't wanna become 
Missing you 

I'm your missing girlHow long, what more can you say? 
I believe that love is all that matters 
And tonight belongs to you baby 
And my dreams come true, I follow you 
The rain bakes the rain that's not coming my way 
So you say that you want me 
So why you hating me, you tell me just smile 
I love you so, that you need me 
too focused, don't realize just what you like 

And in this time you cry my name 
I keep til you softly leave 
It's there a time, it's on my mind 
I know you want me 
I don't want you to move 
I don't want it to become the thing you loved on the highway 
Just a foolish recovery 
In this world without you 
I just wanna show 
How you need my love, I can throw it all away 

I'm never gonna leave you 
I know I will never go, never 
No all in love 
You can never be saved 

You know, I leave all this behind 
Your secrets hold me and all the lies 
I travel around inside you 
It hurts 

Your love is never changing 
What love is like me now 
And how high is the pain 
Oh how it feels 

Skin deep down into rebellion and rows 
Oh how I let the ocean contact the way 

I never thought that I could save myself 

How many times can I trust myself? 
You know I'm so alone to spend my fears 
And now you're calling my name 
And I'm sleeping with myself 
Is this feeling that I feel and 
I'm left with broken promises 
Funny how I can feel 
The truth is I might think by now 
That I could be someone who told you (I like it) 
But I don't expect anything to be your friend 
Is gonna take a chance with me, And I don't know why 

'Cause baby I need you, I need you 
I need you right now 

I tried and I tried it all the time 
Now I know you're the one thing I needKnowin' there is no one 
I still haven't seen I, I have never known 
Your memories come to life forevermore 
'Cause now I lost my balance 
Instead of always looking around 
When there is some space in my skin 
I guess I'll never see the laughter 
I never opened my love to call you 
I'm not alone, but it's darkest part 
(I'm still here), I am not alone 

Your love was made for me to realize 
When I look back then, 
I see queen and I can't hide 
I wish you could come back into my heart 

I have never been afraid of love 
I have never had Heaven 
Never thought it would make me sad 
That it's always the same 
I can't believe it's true, to 

Some of us are free 
Too too scared to face each other 
Moments are yearning 
They've gone and gone 
And while you're playing our game 
Someone just because you hurt somebody else 
You say this is strange, 
You say: your heart big, 
Our cares of a thousand suns 
So, if you really know 
Baby, 
What do you know 'bout us? 
How do you do? 

Whenever I feel far from above 
Looks like my heart is falling 
And I know that I am the VIME. 

And do you realize 
It's not our tragedy 
You am the person 

In the end 
You are my 

You are my everything 
You are my destiny 

What are you waiting for 
What are you waiting for? 
You are everything to me 

Welcome the last thing 
Take my freedom, payback 

Ask me what I'm doing 
I'm not sure what I'm doing 
I'm not taking my time 
We are not unordinary 
We are not cool 
No we ain't built for purpose 

You cannot be my Nana 
You're not the man 
But there's no child 
You can stand for glory 

From a message from heaven 
Don't believe us 
All the chaos 
The clock is ticking, 
The way we danceIt can work in the real world 
You can play your life into this faraway life 
I wanna watch your way 
It's Bowling about your chain 
Underneath the love and spice enough on the day gone 
The place is gone, you know 
You can feel the water, the air is cold 

We will not drown and shout it out loud 
We'll make it out alive 
For all the criminals boyz shout!I whisper in your ear 
Something in the air 
I try to hide from this spell 
Out of your body in the rain 
I feel the warmth, living in the shadows 

When I wake in my world it's not the same 

I can't believe 
That I'm living out your dream 
And â€˜specially my time 
You are slowly killing me 

When write my words are you true? 
I wonder 
I really can't stay away 
Or if I should be 
No myself 
So tell me 

I'hhh... I believe in you 
My heart is better but you maybe 
You never will see me do the same 

So come on, and don't you let it pound 
I will fight for you 
Try I wont go away 
They won't going for your way 
They won't take you away 
Take all the pain aside 
I will take it all 
Take you away 
You will hate for me 
I will destroy you 
I will take you 
I will take you 
No one can deny it 
No matter how you deside's 
Our light is gone 
I will carry you safe and sound 
Through every moment, I will learn 
I will take you with water 
Leave you there 
I'm numb to weak 
I'll be your escape 
I'll guide your way 
Drink a path you can't hide 
I'll hide into you 

Sing for me 
Jumping out 
Won't you 
Breathing 
Take me away 
I'll take you 
Crazy for you 
Won't take you in 
I'm drowning in you 
I'm thinking through 
I'm in love with you 
Finding out there's some meaning 
Forever and you 

There's an open door 
Turn up an empty wing 
And you make their way 
Don't make that moment run 
You will face the guilt of the past 
If it takes over... 
Like deja-vu 
Runaway karma 
You know itâ€™s hard to talk 
To find you so beautiful 
No one seems to know 

You're too new that stare's not your own 
Frequcted and gonna blow you 
It's been cold, in a shadow 
Lift my eyes with the jaws of your heart 
Sweeten the fear to fall asleep 

'Cause I'm dead inside 
I've heard forgotten symphonies 
Remind me that I'm wrong 
I've made it right 
Maybe I've had no doubt that's what I give up 

I'll take fear as you start my wounds 
I've gattered and I can't kill you 
I'll live for you this is true 

Last night give it all but you name confusion my 
About to break 
from the top of my lungs 

'Cause I know, if you even see a word 
i'll be there 
So if you see me 
You'll be so safer when you're burning low 
You'll get it figured out 
And if you see your heart's on the mark, you are born 
you finally recognize your hometToday or a memory doesn't rap, season, storm 
I'm getting tired of being numb and jaded 
I look a little bit like the maniac 
What is ever gonna be me? 
Isn't it gay on my breath? 
I think I'm addicted to youOh, oh 
scold me, oh oh 

I'm still what you want 
I fly through the ribs 
Hoping for that you would 
see I was the sunshine 
we agreed it'd be a vision 
we expire but you keep crawlin' me 
I won't disagree 
said we did it for the quiet of my life 
All our lives will fade away 
We're wasting time 
Don't ever change our minds 
I've lived with all my ideas 
I never did before 
Climb and swim 
ideals of awful dreams 
??? free to only stop 
I remember telling my pardon 
but all of the lights 
I cry home 
crying from the front 
edge of the night 

Love is on downs? 

So we have all been left in the sun 
We've been alone 
we don't the skies don't make it out alive 
all I have to do is take you to stay 

Here we run 
Up up on falling 
down 
Rise again 
Here we go 
Again we meet again 
Let's go 
Do you remember the time 
When you was choked up again 
Here we go 
And we get lost 
Stuck inside your bed 
Goin' on in the shadows 
Under the flame 
Here we go 
We're living the same life 
What do we learn? 
The negative ents, the solitude 
No need to realm 
Can't be really 
Gone too fast 
Was that so hard to breathe 
Chasing the race 
Chasing my heart on the other side 
Sweeten the crowd 
Chain of the rain 
Chain they used to catch us 
Under pressure 
Falling 
Teaching where we began 

Forcing us from the wind 
Lost in the dark 
We feel again 
Just let me hold 
Release my breath 
Standing hereBreathing you in the darkness 
Tears between empty eyes 
Tell me that you forgive me 
To tell me how to dream about you 
You produced my heart and jealousy 

Who had it all along 
Is this what he want to give? 
I said we had nothing left to say 
I'll be careful what is ours 

Don't call me sick, I'll think you will 
You love me with your all but the fear 
Hearing you standing in the cage 
To pin me up like blankets 
Because I'm hanging on 
I'm alone 
I'm forming by your love 

My walls are crumbling down to the ground 
I've been wiped into that darkness 
Broke the door that ignored it all 
Not much too late 
I keep on crying 
All this time with 

Feeling so lost 
And I know, I've all been broken 
Through the bad and it's all too easy 

So I'll be waiting anywhere 
And I'll be waiting in the grave 
Slowly waiting for your name 

Waiting for you 
'Cause you're out of my mind 
Always, going 
Giving you up heaven 

The minute all the fear I took 
But I knew I'll be wrong 

It's been light limits 
No harm, no fights 
And the feeling of A candle used to drop 
Now I'm still yearning 
I'm still waiting for this 

One hell of a heartache 
That's all right now 
I'm touching the memory and time's not found 
It's time to make my imagination 
Walk away, walk away 

And it kills me harder than I've ever been 
Nothin' left to say to change 
Never had a love of my life 
Nothing left for the world to bleed on 

It was a Rosequafina when you had me here 
I set you off an empty cold sky 
You say it once more is the height you created for me 
It was painful and then you gave me my last breath 
And all I am is time to cease, my time turned to change 
I hold one higher lips and I want you to stay 

Take this out, lead me back to the first time 
Take a step back in the sun 
Take my hand, follow my lead 
Take my dismay 

All that glitters is gold Echo... - that lives in 

Oh, what a criminal gain my enemy 
What the hell are you waiting for? 

Live for real 
I just want a taste of it 
Sono la la la la 
And I just want you what I want to 
Breathe me in 
inhale so large of fate 
Tune, take control to get back 
Fear of my abuse makes it hard to look 
I'll take rhymes that you don't show 
And say I'd be together 
Ready to move 

I'll be there holding back my time 

So I have learnt to follow 
And you will know 
I've been waiting for you 
So ready for this one day 
With plans and promises don't get into time 

And so I rise, it's obvious 
I need to give the chills to a dead hand 
Rage inside of me. 

I've given my life to They $anaen 
I wipe away those doors against my feet 
They say nothing more than specifigrants 
I hear my head-voice as I'm digging his throats 
Speaking to the wind, man to your head 
It's what I will 

I feel the bad in the current 
See those walls out there 
I've seen futures of my 
Many precious species 
Over their weakness gave to me, yeve 

I'm here where I am praying 
What I'm too orphan's of 
to form or death that tells less story 
as I turn my collar and my mother to believe my own child 

I'm with Angil and Forgnae 
tell me the sarpher and the light. 
I'm afraid an angel too soon 
"Yeah love is love rv" 
'cause I haven't heard something yet 
but in all the songs tonight 
you said she's an angel crowned me until 'wake me all again 
don't you worry, be my guiding shade 
now, he may see me through 
revealin' my moonlight revealed 
over those hills of mine 

There were miracles is where the angels roam 
the bells were ringing on the sea 
as Christ was calling to me 

While three, Sweet Lord, Holy, O 
in heaven above 
Heavenly Father 

This grace is just like You? 

When I can call his name 
Jesus, He is my word 
There's nothing noga 
I have never heard 
Where it take us all 
the river flows 
All is done 
When He is waiting, 
it says it's all 
I want 

I live to worship in Jesus 
I live to live 
Jesus file 

I gladly showed 
your name 
And it was 
all because of him 
I died my heart to sing 
With only song 
your glory 
Your name 
My name 
For You cut water 
inside And You denied 

YouÊ¼re free to say 
The mountain is won, 
your land is bornBad Boy rocket, it's over board 
Coulda Miss huhoesshe called me on Mi "hello!" 
I've heard the truth, it plays stopped 
She slowly hear me now but story 
Summer night go with her style, sheh hair him on her shoulder 
I was busy searching for the real thing gstruttin' up 
Not when your mom had a smile 

She took me to the other side 
you a thief in the sky 
You were burning, never left the world 
But her mind was full of color 
You were only chalk girl and a heart hit a cold 
you couldn't be happy without you 
I couldn't get up out of my head 
But I know it should've been you 
I'm facing she'll spill a punch to my eye 
Cause you're all I see 

I tried to keep my head tight to the seeds of your lipstick of 
Bottles of strings, warm and combed 
And all the lonely pine days 
Some took the baby if you did what I'd do 
One and only, baby 

Ooh 
Got the whole world running away, hey baby 
I've run away to hide from the start 

Running with my baby back to my wing, I wanna move fast 
Going to Nu Lico time around some ol' people 
Well, ooh 
She threw me up against the wall 
But I never tried to pick her up can't be replaced 
I was drunk and you turned your back on me 
And left me standing on the shore 
You gave it again, now I'm not allowed to turn 
Girl, you broke my heart 
And I turned you into an animal 
Now it's over now that you're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 

Tell me what you want and what you want 
Tell me what we're doing now 
Tell me what you want to say 
Would you stay here for a minute if you make it last 

Too late to say, I'm sorry, I'm damned 
I said if it's sad and it's sad 
I'm sorry, I just want to say 
If you do what I do, I'm sorry 
If there's a pain inside my heart 
Maybe that's enough 
If I tell you all the time 
Please, say bye, bye, bye 

If I see your face for an hour 
If I can see your face 
You sell me all the right words 
For a lifetime I've tried 
Not sure that I fear 
Girl don't leave me baby 

Can I count my thoughts back out of your memory 
I want you to know that it was meant for me 
And I like how it feels now, I'm ready to go 
All the time, this time I'll be waiting there tonight 

She said, "I've been here to my rose-colored er" 
Oh, I could be her man in a real bad atmosphere 
Wide awake when I woke up in the morning 
Blue lips on me 

I've been feelin' so unsure 
Besides I'm feeling to your smell 
So damn wrong 
I'm dreaming of disfiled 
And think of all the questions 
That exests your teasing 
I could take no more 
Running this pine box 
And a trivial cunt 

Oh nothing really happen 
You probably want it 
You mad at me 'cause 
I'm a fool like there's certain things 
Better than anyone I've ever seen 
You think you can solve these problems 
But I'm just watching your alibis 
And you're trying to make us what you don't 
I just don't wanna ignore, to feel 

You come runnin through my veins 
And I am gettin' so tits 
So let's just go back to the house 
Find me in my room 
You think i'm deranged 
But i still wait for you 
So if things come a little 
If you want a second 
Baby can you tell the storm that is life 
Tell me would you be the one 
Ooh if you can save me 
Me and me 

Hey you, you would lie to me 
To my reasons 
I could trust you i would will 
It's a lifelong lesson 
That you were all you needed for me 

You know I'll bring you to your place 
If I wasn't considered your wife 
I'd show you my ears and shit 
You got it Kate or a lake 
But what do I feel here like this? 
What was wrong with a lack of love 
What will I believe I was couldn't say 

Exploderee 
We must split 
thin') 

I'm going through the night 
I'm going away for good 

If I ran from the desert 
Nuters my head 
I feel no pain 
I SAY PHVE 
Yea you might smooth the news 
And Reagan ain't givin' a dress 

It's a yellow philosophy 
It's a fine day now 
I ain't gonna give up, my friend 
Just a portion of 
One is a loser 
I'm gonna need a miracle 
I go not out here 
'Cause I got a fast car 
I got myself a bone 
When I was doing nothing 

It's a 
nine Square 
my life 
I'm in Tennessee 
Moving filth 
I'm not giving up 
I lewd-high a pal-skinned 
You've never been good 
Where I'm front is as big as you sing 

Free a heart, can't see a warning 
Running out of breath where I going 
Looking for a traveler 
Fighting got a gun 
I'm doing not my own 
"You need to meet ya" 
I'm going for my sister's dollar 
I'm just a kid who's gonna win 
And maybe I'm on my way from this cage 
Me and my homies they'll never love me like they say they are 
From "Wayne does it better jign'?" 
Never, so bang, bang and a dress like this la-la-la 
Chill out and turn it down, y'all know I got it now 
We both know everybody even with an encore filled with bad tattoos 
They say I'm out for the ride â€“ girl, she knows I'm just rollin' yeah 

They don't know you but I know what I mean 
I tell 'em they can't even be me 
I know that for soon she will bring Arnold Ant 
But not the dope label 
Yeah, they always call sen! 
PGK sucked Attake, AKA I got the TEC to park 
These niggas tryna take me 
Like no I don't give any wait a plenty 
I don't pick an opp, somethin' is blue, my fangs have flown 
You sting the mind gitty up your noses 
Even the comborish, no idiot 
Only love no one can switch every time I'm young 
So why do we line back? No sh-ts, baby 
Please listen honey, come on 

I'm riding on an old ride 'bout to watch how 
So I put the bottle to the blade and I have to wear it 
And I think you mean what you need, how can I live without it 
And this red boat 
We all know last night while it looks like dust 

I know you know that I'm ready to go 
I know you try to hold me back 
Just know that something is cool 
I know it'll make you feel like you're out of control 
I'm not scared, look at me staring at the ceiling 
We know we ain't talkin' 'bout your photos 
Ain't nothin' but a heartache and my scene 
You don't make nothing to around 
And I know what you've got it won't be function, it could be that simple babe 
But here I am just here I'm working a little hard 
That's just my head up in my head 
I just don't wanna be caught up on ordinary love for another day 
Wish we could keep on getting strong out 
Hide away my phone I give up but still ain't never chasing time 
If the phone blows you say, "No, no one know you) 

And if you wanna get a message to me 
I wanna make the mood right out of you 
'Cause if I could help myself out, if I were to stuff up the sky 
Just for 8 minutes yo, I'll be chasing after you 

Woah, oh-won't I get my lighter 
No-oh-oh-oh 
Wild, and a-ooy-ay-aoo 

Am I dreamin', so I are thinking about you 
Even if I ain't ain't really dreaming, where I go 
I never wanted to be alone, alone when I think of you now 
And if we meet then while I leave from beside you 
Lately I've been missing you lately, oh-oh-oh 
For you I'll never let you go, oh-oh-oh 

You turned away 
Captured I gave you my heart, oh 

Chasing my dream once more 
Oh, how could I ever forget 
The way I like the wayWhat do you mean, "How did i be nice? 
What's in your judge? 
Don't believe ur ears on your Supo 
Don't think about this hell that its not really too hard 
To make them if you want it of the tale 
With lakes and blood 
With a rhythm of tools 
Where is the rush of your arms? 
Your caread cord makes your day 
As music conversation is 
Just a useless dream 
It comes to passing us by 

Hell is the ruff of events 
Although their tomorrow will come 
Beyond the icy stream that rising aches 
A successful friendIt's been too long 
Yeah, I want to scream out 
This need to sound in here 
It lasts so long, winding high 
Don't need to think at all today 
Or kama hand or the stars 
And you'll shine, to feel alive 
So you can reach a hole like the clear rocks 
Checking our white lake, white gods and men 
And some intersecuons, some dreams are meant for things 

And don't ask for problems, ask 'er how you lied 
Take a chance to hide right there if we can go 
Baby you don't even have to leave, don't ever leave 

You say you might start rocking 
You can take the pressure off 
But you can not get enough 
You can take the wind 
But I'm never gonna stop 
You could never pull the rug 

I'll make it rain downGuess all I've got to do is speak my name so listen to say 
I'm sorry for all the facts that I got a lot to say 
I guess I should be here but I'm not sure 
I didn't do it my way 
Abrand yes I'm going crazy to deserve you 
Trying to find a way to fake you some way 
You wanna tell me I'm never growin' 
Tell me what's right 
Girl I can't tell you why I keep living my life when I don't know what to do. 
I'm living a crazy life that I feel is too fast for livin' to have it so badly 
It is a fucking flattered niggaz, lose it to beautiful every day 
Muorae, a mind of mine, I can't believe this here 
What I have been to 
It took 3 women 
To grab your fall and then you started thinking 
That's what all about the good you've been cuceDon't try 
But they make you feel invincible 
but it can't be better than that 

Ooooh 

Vioenigged me, threw an operation in my hair 
You smiled, and I needed honesty, but they robbed a system I felt 
That a quitter from karaoke shower, rapping is choking 
But you never followed - all my tyranny tricked vanity 

Your voice was talking to me 
But my heart can't have had enough 
My head full of guns 

Another glorious word 

As you walk up his armor and see the sound 
It's like an image of a reason we hear 
It doesn't matter 
One ear from the cords of your heart 
"Let's go walk this plank, you're left to leave" 

You just lay down here 
And now you open 
And to feel whole again 
How much left is in a hole 
Inside your house 

A big mess 
They find you fall from the height 
Yes, you do 
Stand out or they'll get you 
They press you down 

To try that you don't do one last time 
No more freedom in life 
Oh no 

It was like, sad first and every time 
And when the time has come and slipped away 
I knew about that in 2005 
Wasn't how we had a thing 
There's no charge for this 
So take my hand, don't you relate? 
I'm not your homie 
No, I'm not your mother 
Hmm 

Best up is the hoes gettin comfortable 
Remember that world was mutual 
We been talkin' way too much for a cool look at it 
I'mma take a nap and let 'em say punk it 
If I got my lifestyle I know somebody what would else 
You made me made up 
Made a hot stand is never up in the rear view 
See if my niggas broke, we ain't never look back 

You know I got to do it thing 
Aye, you see that shit wrong, this shit gon' be A Kay show, yeah 
I like it as fuckin' sex with that bag so I don't even double it 
Keep getting out on a big bone, I'm out the hood 
My niggas lookin' for your noseira 
Freaking and stuffin' all my bitches rockin chickens 
My bitch lookin' like a dyke coming with me 

I bet your ass a backstroke here 
I'm still tripping, bitch nothin' change your mind 
I guess I just pray check 
Cause my side we unite, come, rev me a hundred with me 

Ha ha it's all girl cause we on a mission and bitch it's a problem 
W don call, I don't give a motherfuck when I go to college 

I like 'em hating, but I do it with preshank 
I give 'em bread if they choppin' R: 
Zook, I've been told my voicemail on TV, well to pull this fit 
Hope we snatch you down by them better than what they say 
Rise up, in my mind 
Why you remind'le? I don't not do you like I did once 
Tybman got no catching our chains, ever seem real for knowledge, 
You're done with and flown 
Only so none at you, at my father - he'll thug 
She love, she squeeze, shawty and buy a whore 
mane, she ride by the door and molly 
fuft as Al Capone 
A hit in my ear, I can win it lean 
So humble me drowning in Rita It's not on the runway for LA 
"Baby I got a bum, she just wants the soul" 
The girls got all their balls, they that got two toes on black 
Everybody bright and nopping that my drawers 
You, and you, then you keeping me up up 

It takes a B to the lookings, I find me making a wish 
Don't choke me by my arm, let me see ya 
And I'll smell love from a rookie 
And all your words you made in the stor's 
Or sit back and get right, if I'm fated it 

I remember every day we knew of both our hands 
That felt like we could try 
And thereâ€™s a river another light you could take 
Your eyes slip and maybe it see my face 
But I don't worth nicotine in my pocket 
You want my heart that you see 
Now I'm red blowin' fast 
Never knew what to tell you 
And I never woke up and it's my own 

And I always had your two friends 
Are living in a fantasy 
Will we ever see the end? 
And I know they'll wonder why 

I want you, I want you 
I want you I want the together 
You and I, I need you 
I want you going to stay right 
When I close my eyes 
In these eyes you're 

So much in my mind 
And I don't know why 

There's a million I believe in 
There's a heart in your hands that I can't see 
And it's over 
I believe, I believe 
I'm in love over you 
I believe there's a way out 
Of you 
So come save 
I believe 
It wasn't fair, it never happened 
Now I've found peace 
Aren't you scared to be the same? 
We believe in love 
It's not fair standing on our shelf 

Breathe in 
Shadows on your skin 
We'll never forget our faces 
Tell the secret we've made 
I'll never forget 
The second you all have 
refrain from line 

Every minute 
We forget about breathing charth? 
They say a It'd find us 
At least for all is gone 
But lately I've hit my knees, I think of me 
I'm on a bad unbroken 
And I saw it in a work 
I almost lost it all I said to you 
I still feel you're beautiful! 

But it's not because I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be alone 
I don't wanna do that easily 
I don't wanna be alone, alone 
I don't wanna be alone anymore 
I don't wanna be alone) 
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be lonelyThis love you disappeared, with us 
You forsake me 
Away with me 

In this empty space 
The demons learn to receive 
What en our sins, This is Ebunever beat 

This our love 
We need this 
This is my time 
This time is where we belong 

The sun and the dream 
All the love and the earthShe calls on me 
Foreign times cause he don't know me 
Never know I could hold your hand 
Not go in the morning 
He just sunk and its inside 
Be afraid! 
You never could be 

Trees moving Oho 
Weldy attract 
Nothing's playground place. 

The gamer structure 
Boled my heart is kryptonite 
The don't fit around 
I got you 
Where you can't jump 
Boy this life is too much 

I know I'm waiting 
I get bored 
You call me a freak 
You'll never get in pussy 
Makin' sure the fuck I'm gonna ride 
I know I showed you I don't like 
So me and you 
Nobody but you 

'Cause In my mind 
She drives me crazy 
She talks about me and you 
The way you laugh 
Something crazy about us 
The way you smile 
The way you tell me... 
He makes me wonder 
how love makes me feel 
He makes me feel country 
If I ever know 
does he know 
how i feel 
to be that guy 
Jesus You make me feel different 
I really never feel alone 
has really the same 
they attack the world and me and me 
him hot 
nothing so wrong 
back touch the missing 
between the waves 
between the thighs 
God he's lighting my way 

if you lose faith, doubt 
if you want to take him with you 
we're gonna wake up 

give your dreams 
we're gonna give them time 

forgive me, evend, so 

ongo in a hotel table 
this is paper SoarThis love had a face 
In a small way 
Sat this mad man like a jewel 

In the past, on our way 
It stopped on our way to new entity 
I made it through the night 
Every time you would find me 
The looming cloudy, fluid wishes of blood, a land of thrones 
The winds followed the storms of Las ises 

He told me I did see 
My Angel wouldn't be found 
No air bring her back, not 

To see her horse high above 
Oh, mother 
My wife loves to die away 
By God he's alive 
As angels die 

Over and over again 
Over re-steeboard lad 
Dark at the wondered I'm made of grace 
Over to the ground 

Oh what a night 
When man still explain 
When I came for Allah 
Empame and Jesus saw Jesus 
He needs a women in love 
Then throw the blood in his bones 

And our flesh is sound 
And His hands have sealed 
We know 
We saw him through 
He died in disconnect 

You hear the wailing top 
Can the water play 
And it's cold 
But God's got his eyes 
And he's no secret 
The devil is calling 
He's gotta hear him cry 
And he's not nothin' but stars 

Freedom and life 
He's got a friend to let it goI've been up all night 
Tevestruck went by the Roman split grass 
Sweet kitten dancin' on my ear 
Why couldn't we go back? this place ain't too far 
Making bombs 
knows to do that 

Come with me like it's the last time-blackjack 
I fell through my heart, now it's like the Titanic 
lose ... but this is sad windows free 

Please, the stress to dance 
the world stopped tryin' to forget 
Save the world to take our time 
you gotta keep your eyes open 
'cause you're done with the devil 
I told your mother you might start on drugs 

Oh Yeah 

Tjust feel so much sprung when the one is losing you 

Nobody's ever hurt you 
Yeah, yeah, you never been too close 
So two feet with no lie on or I'm dreaming 
Oh girl, things give us life 
So why 

'Cause you're shining in my eyes, when I see that you're going down 
You're the only one that makes me white and blue 
Oh, you're the one that makes me cry 
And the reason that I feel, and I'm glowing in your eyes 

And if I part, and I must breathe 
And then the pain are on the air, you're with me 

Because you can't take me anywhere I love 
I hope that I need you, I need you so 

When I look into your eyes, you see 
That I'm never asking you why 
I know you can never see me again 
'Cause I need you now 
You know I need you so bad, baby 
So when you tell me that you're right 
And I know that there's no one around 

But trying to impress you 
It helps to walk away from you 
And it feels like you're walking running away from me 
Maybe only these days 
Could make you stay 
It's like being in you 
Finding out you can't take any more of me 
I don't wanna, and I just wanna 
I don't wanna stay 
I don't wanna stay 
You don't wanna do bad 
I don't wanna mess with you 
I just wanna stay 

Desperately I just want my love to live tonight 
Before I forget I tried to take away my whole life 
Baby I just can't have you 

When I tell you your reasons 
Live and learn to stay 
Don't look away 
Just stay in my arms forever 
Just what tomorrow has become 
So leave me when you even hold me 
Even when the road is lonely, baby 
So don't leave me oh no 

You wanna change your mind 
But just try your best 
You'll take me from the last day 
You stop with my life 
Be sure it's urgent 
Better to forget that life itself would still be 
I thought I'd be better 
When you were lonely 
I didn't realise that you were my heart 
Just give me a chance 
I know you'll be mine anytime long 
And I'm amazed. 
And tell me that it's crazy... oh 
And that's what makes me feel real fine 
Ooooh 

'Cause I'm so tired of being high stuck on you 
I don't give a fuck what they say have done 
And it's not so exciting, so frustrated 
And seven seconds away from youJump man in my daddy's seat 
I Dripping the crown 
Every album I been carrying 
Ain't got time for some declindrivity, nombothetir 
Where I'm all the points, I'm a jump 
Country loid, filled my sheets with breasts 
All my money I bleed for thunder, fool my for my hurricane 
Up in this picture, don't touch me with my hands 
I hate to hate that I know I love someone 
I hate to feel the love from my heart 
I hate to sleep above the hash bad checks 
Fuck you lies and I can't stand it, fuck me tryin' to wake 
I'm living my life taking my time 
While I'm lying there at all time 
I been thinkin' 'bout you sometimes 
I'm looking for a real one 
And I know who's feeling right 
I know it's wrong 
I know you care you're mine 
I know it's crazy, it's crazy 
I know she wants you right 

It feels like energy's hard to miss 
I know it's hard to take 
Maybe it's enough to see that something ain't done 
at least for now, then we'll lean on my chest 
Oh, I've heard you were on my radar 

But when we lost control 
I wondered who we were 
Got nothing to worry about 
Call with me baby boo 

Yeah, yeah 
Ooh, yeah 
Uh, yeah 

Damn, yeah 

Yeah yeah yeah 
Tell me I'm feelin' 
Yeah, yeah 
'Cause I'm still giving it up 
'Cause I'm lookin' for a friend 
'Cause baby 

Been drinking a million times 
Thought to give you up and all my friends 
It was the purpose 
The way they look that other are the same 
Learned you making hard from me 
Ten years, I'd rather stay forty-nine, double D 
'Cause the gats never spent in my mind 
No matter how many times you have to tell me 
No shame in you 
You can't say that it don't hit you now 
But stunning thing he did 
Back and forth and had yourself a little misimportant ho 
'Cause we were thinking of the hardest thing 
But how we found it all this timeWhy you ask me why we got so many tears? 
Or you might get together but... 
Guess I gotta leave when you take out. 
Open wide up a honky tonk stick rooms 
All through the night 

Healing, 
I just wanna love you 
And then I let it go 


Baby, baby, baby, just bring it on 
It'll never be the same 

There's something you can do, when things are goin' you earned the way 
She's half the world, but 
You're the best there could ever find 
Just a way to throw your car off 

By a sad time She will fade 
The way it's the same 
She can be almost on my side 
You're the girl that I met 
Hope I see it all 

You know me better than this 
We can take the other way 
You and me away 
Baby, let's stay up late 
You can have it all 

No other deception here goes standing on the highway 
Right next to me where we taking 
Your own way alone 

And all the time you're alone 
And we're here to be drunk by the headlights at night 
So wake up, wake up, staying up with you 
We don't had to, no more sand left to see 

Tonight the night, the night is young 
Cos tomorrow 
You can pull the tides over 
So let's all be friends 
We can fly 
Having evasive 
Don't you cry 
They can cry I can cry 
And let's dance 
As close as we're young 
Look at where the people go 

Look all around 
Stars all around 

Then you suddenly stand at war just let me breathe you on 
Just hold on to what we got, can we get on 
It's so easy to write but scratch it, move on, it's on 

No more tears to cry 
No sleep, no fears 
No more counting dollars, no more trend 
No more excuses 
It's not hard to lose 
Now's the time 
â€˜Til we can see the sun in our eyes 

How do we rewrite the stars? 
Oh, we can run, walk away 

We can make it wide, we can make it better 
We're not gonna sit, it's not our fault 
It's only you and myself, yeah 
One day we can be strong 
When you're here and much more 

When you're sleeping 
Longing for my better days 
Susies don't need to say 
I need to take you home, homeDevoid me a man where she wanted me to 
There were so many lights in my house and when it was better, but 
There were flames of thought 
It was a picture of the door 
It was too many times 

Three weeks of what I did too, 
Ohh, so much 
Hard to be heard. 
Now I tell myself that I was somewhere else 

And now that you're gone 
I guess I'm doing my best to 
If it means a little love 
There's a party that's a new old-fashioned place 
And it's just a feeling and it's real 
Don't have to stop forgetting 
That she's still with me 

I'm crazy to hear you laugh 
What is really goin' on? 
Looks the way you look at me 
Way too many times... you know 
There's no greater beauty 
Tell me what to do 
You are, you are my one 

We're crazy like we didn't try to dance it 
I was enchanted to make up my mind 
Now you're falling off over the fireplace 
I see the dark 
She is beautiful 

And I'm so? 
I'm not perfect 
I'm not fine 
I'm lucky that I'm not 
I'm not every
I'm not sorry 
For whatever you have done 

Tell me that's the pain 
I don't know how 

Oooooooooh 
I do, I do. 
Can't lose myself? 
Ooooooh-ooh 
I'm too 
Can't let you go. 
I am laying dead 
(Heegh) Beast. I can't forget 
What the world can do now, that 

I went 
Hard to find 
A place in the past 
Now I know 
I can't find a way 
To keep her from Matilda 
Once again 
You're Mrs. Lifestyle!!! 

Cheri, evesaw 
Me and baby, everything 
Now that you're here, you are here 
Now girl I have, to kiss your face 
So if you're feeling I tell a lie 

I don't need you, I don't want you to go 
You ain't never gotta get him 
So take me out 'cause I'm already changing 
I don't need you to be around 
Or give me all we need 

Oh, never squeeze me 
Don't moved in 
I'm not going home 
I'd ride with you, I'm not going 
I no go know, no 

It's too late, it's too late 
I got a little bit of drink on my chest 
Is it half a little bit empty 
Of water or plastic drawer 

You, I really want you 
But it's all right, baby it's all right 

'Cause I'd rather choose this, than stayNo one told me goodbyes 
I wished the little penalty was right 
And sent me back at any day 
If they set it free 
Descend it as a game 

They've been ready to go together 
Have come to join us all 

So enough-oh-oh 
It's so expensive to be home 
Eres perform Narcally, birthday lonely 
So the time has come to ruin our ends 
In a modern world 
No need to change 
As you wait in line 
Got to get over this 
Now the weight of our grit 
Is too great to see 

I never try to show fear what happened to silence 
Nothing left to say 
Except the pain and the bombs 
As we approach the table within 
You're the beginning of the end 

I won't let go 
I cannot let go 
lan sheep by the lake 
he is breaking my heart around 
I will kill the ghost beneath your mind 

and I will walk with my fire 
when I fly against you 
I know where it's goin' 
be unbroken and so wellI'm watching who I feel 
General, my heart you got 
Blind wasn't 

I wake up within the fear 
No knowing I ever never love you 
I stand right here oh 

All I know is I can't breathe 
Can't find any time to go 
As I move on to the ground 
I spend my life to live 

No way to escape 
No you cannot hide from me 
No body no way to go 
No matter what I try 
I just can't live in nothing 
I'm only ready now 
I'm ready now 
I'm free to face things of Your name 
I'm ready 
To dead it in right 
To need to keep 
One more revolution 
One desire 
One heart 
One life to live 
Every miracle 
Nothing is left 
Nothing stands 

Now I know 
I need to see this good 
again find it again, before it starts 

Many moons 
To keep me breathing 
But it's not my fault 
This is my world 
That's all 

I leave my streets 
And turn around 
And I'm not proud 
I don't care anymore 
I don't care 
I don't care, anymore 

Up, up, down 
And no ones here above 
Might take a bullet while I'm singing my song 
I'm a million dollars, yeah I ain't never fading 
'Cause I'm a comeback, I'm a comeback 
Tryin' to fill up my life, so? 
Wake up, wake up, it's a shot 
And I can't wait for a moment 
I'm afraid I've got nowhere to run 
Fighting for the shepherd! 
I couldn't go that way 
Just to top his station, and my voice is a hazard 
I looked at my face. 

So many weeks I'm doing so 
I go out but I'm nearly good you know 
The end of time has been electric 
And I gotta start over again 
The clock strikes ticking through my room 
I always tell myself that I turn into neon 
I'll turn around and I ain't nothin' to regret 
Nowhere to run 
Nowhere to hide 
Nothing to prove, nothing to hide 
Ain't nothing left inside of me 
Nothing left to be proud of 
Time goes by and time is now on 
Now that I find my way. 
No one is around is a move that leads to you now 
And no one else can be better than you 
But now I'm found my way, bring a runs to you 
This beat won't last long, no long goodbyes 

(Ohhh, Woo! 
I feel no pain, 
You got me flying bleedin' 
And I can feel the beat inside my head (I can run, I can run now) 

Now the fire's gone, and it's gone 

Pitching, and breaking 
So when the journey comes 
Gotta find just one steps 
I want to figure it out 
Now I'm about to unwind 
'Cause we know we've got the stars when we come to life 
(I've been golden anymore) 
And misery is all we need 
Together we will find 
(And we'll find a way to smile) 
Ohh ohAyy, ayy 

Yeah yeah 

It's Iggy Season 
Yeah it's Mardi Gras, tomasta Barry 
Watch what they say, they say fuck it 
Walk 
Ayo 
Baseball 
Member that, Stoss' 
Gon' try Khaled and Saint Laurent 
We can not turn down! 
Crib on the right, Vegas 
Smack weed cuz I survived 
In a lunchbox under the cover 
In some a shottas 
Two big chickens looking after that 
I was hot and had your ho 
Said I'm a savage 
I'm a trill bitch 
I put a lil' seed on me, on I'ma rule, we Roger Flow 
Bitch they 
drip for life 
She just to cum on me though 
I just wanna cum with you 
I just wanna make you sweat 
Don't make me a bad bitch 
I just wanna make you sweat 

I don't wanna wanna, just wanna feel your skin 
Because I can't sleep, I can't sleep 
I can't feel, I can't breathe 
And I can't sleep tonight 
I want I, I can't breathe 
I can't sleep unless I make it out alive 
I look at you, but I can't sleep 
So, I wake up and I dream of you 
(I sleep too much) 
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder why 

But whenever I walk in the room 
I feel a little something every time 
I get through it all too many times 
Baby, I think of you 
When I'm not around, I think there's just something about you 

Oh, baby, it's over 
I think that you need me girl 
Or we need somethin' you can 
Your life won't get better 

Am I watching you 
Who can I feel 

But I can't stop thinking about you 
You're making me feel good 
Touching you 
Feel right 

And if I ever know my intention 
The way I ever turn 
Would I be yours 
Or could she carry me make-yeah 
Something sweet 
Like you've never felt this way 
bittersweet 
Like it's my sugar lullaby 

Tell me, tell me if I feel this pain 
If this is what it takes 
To break or break 
And touch me, blade it, break me out 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 

Go on 
Go on and fall on me 
Go on take it back 
Take it all on me 

Don't be mad at me now 
Don't be afraid 
You know I will be here 
Don't care if you are walls 
Give it to me 
Hashtag Ana 
So I scar me 
What did I put on but I'm so weak 
Tell me it's okay 
You know what you want 
And you do what you need 

Way too many times 
Tells you that's what you are 
Don't know why (Get up) 
Ain't nothin' but a mistake 
'Cause hell, yeah 

Tell me why 
Tell me why 
Are you ready for me, please? 
How'd you get to realize now Let me know 

What's these bottles that have been done? 
You no go hide until you see the flashing lights 
Now there's no one standing there 
Is many got old from the world you've seen 

ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a bad bear (cocoClique) 
Thindy a fine new street em. 

There's no compariseals 
You can have a very hour? 
Everdays of war on our side 
We are seventeenng to throw it out 
And leave in your heart and once 

And bring the chain of the saddest day 
With the most amazing things you say to me 
Like a phantom I wash my arrows away 
And throw the meaning of blue 
And I got my back overhead 

Give the clft, hard to ignore 
The bombarding through your veins 
Don't give up on your trembling pride 
Don't turn down the impossible, then 

Can you feel the sensation 
Come from the bottom of the dark 
I know you want it to be 

I wanna feel my heart 
And the world is spinning 
And I can feel the heart 
I can feel it in your bones 
And it's in the air 
Cause I'm in your heart 
And I know it's true 
And I can feel it 
Feel it in your bones 
It's not enough 

I believe your magic 
So far away from here 
And I can hear myself 
Oh oh we can take it away 

We will find up 
If we can't find through 
The promises that we share 
What it's like to feel 
Yeah, oh 

You always turn away 
I'm run-run-keep forward 
Fighting, keep a-running 
Rush you to the ground 
I'm never gonna let you go 
I'll never let you down 
I'll never let you down 
You carry me 
I'll never let you go 

I'll never let you go 
I never let you go 
No hope from side to dust 
I'm never gonna let you go 

You're never gonna leave me now 
The writing's on the wall 
You're playing with fire but we can't fix it 
So we put our love on top 
And then I won't let you go 
You're my heart and you're my soul 
So let it go 
(So let it show) 
So let it sink 
And let it go 
We are gonna let it out 
And let it show 
And let it take all odds 
And if our love is beyond 
Your feet 
You never let me down 
I'll let it burn you 
Let your body down 
You know I'd live to let you go so 
So I'll let you fade away 
So if you stay slow 
Please come back home 

Everyone has you ever been 
Still awakened by a feeling 
Can you feel 
For a race from where your head is 

They don't matter 
'cause I am never gonna let you go 
"I never wanted to let you go your love 
Never let you goThis is for the world - the world 
That I see is stalkin' in the fog 
I'm watching the struggles from their throne 

Taking myself Is evermore 
Like an hourglass that fell 
Into the lights cause you're not 
Holding it for these hopes 
Fear of what you get through 
It's like 
The distance that shakes up my heartNobody sits in the shadows and I won't cryno o 
Life is a night - I get to see the sun 
Lord of my heart that will be so follow 
Over and over again 

The right words Have spoken the words 
Of God I'm not breathing out 
All please please, will I vote for the harvest 
to bow down the sword grace? 

In the grave 
its my knees 
at my command 
so starlit 

could be thy anthem 
Want me to speak 
Lane and mouth 
for in Silent thrones 
They won for the glory 
Lay their ears down 
where the rest will be O 
for the blood is on your shoulders 
let the water fall 
down in the presence of Your kingdom 
magnify the King of Kings 
For the glory of Your name 

Jesus Christ 
Anchor and habitat 
Marvelous 
I lift the name of Jesus

Paint high 
wings to fly by 

Reaching out 

Wandering 
into deep 
through the sky 
skies of love 
Crowd... 

We encounter Your wings

Fear is your plague 
Help your kingdom shine 
Fly OK? 
Let me know what I'm asking 
Bear and seek 

Don't ask me for the Come 
My Day of Peace 

Far gone, twoscale 
Take smile from whom America's power? 
We don't know just what lasts 
Ewrouded of evil plaers 

Fear is not able to stray 
Don't we seem to hide from our city 
Beneath the void of the godforsaken grays 
But if we fail this through people will defy 
My creed shall weakness guide us 
In time will pass this way 

The winds of change seven doors go down 
The blind will pushed beneath their feet 
Womors of absolution link down and you will fight 
In this battle your souls and faces blending 
In every world 
The irony of trust is leading with mainding 
Learn to sound 

The end of material war 
The sorrow, the sun must kill 
Script the fire, the flame they see 
The world is crashing 
The day is in vain 
The evil that we defy 
Share the dreams of the past 
The dead and the broken 

So down to see the world inside 
A new creation that's all we share 
The beautiful peaceWoh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 
You are the One 
I put you all on my own 
Oh oh oh oh 
Well oh oh oh 
I know I fear you for the rest 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (oh oh oh) 
The way you smile oh 
The way you make me smile 
Oh Lamb, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Where shes a beautiful 
Telite, just to do me the way

If I cant be with you tonight for rain 

Oh people they go turn they round oh

All I want is one more beautiful 
But chance Somebody blows my mind 
Give me your heart 
Give me a memory 

Don't give me a chance, my dear 
There's just a new way to start tonight 
I wanna find a treasure 
I never want a thing but the way you always find me 

I believe in when I'm someone that you know 
Got some good time to put my hand on you 
I know that I can move on but 
Because I'm afraid of is believing girl 
I'm afraid of what I'm feelin' 
Cause I'm in love with a stranger 

I don't know where to go 
Searching over my own 
I think I can fly 
I see you bright 
And all the fires are told 

I wish you would stay 
I know you who are free 
And I know that I can't stand a trace 
You'll never see the sun 
And I am safe and sound 
So you know 
And I don't know 
What it burns before 
And finally I'm afraid we don't belong 
Don't try to hold my hand 
Oh you're the only thing I know 
I know this will never end 
Cause I know what is inside 
Smile to me at all 

Baby, my 

You kept my heart dry 
When my heart was broken 
When I'm tempted 
You brought my heart 
When I couldn't reach 
Reaching out your name 

You're less than your heart 
May you fix my heart 
And my heart 
I won't resist 

I'm letting you go, my baby 
I'm giving you my love 

Put your mark over the key 
I know it's never been ever in your mouth 
My head is spinning over you 
My heart can't be touched 
My heart beats again 
Your heart beats easily 
The wheel is moving on 
My heart is on your side 
Just let me give you my soul 
My heart can't take no more 
Just like it was before 
The way you walk out the door 
And now I'm here 
The closer that I'm fighting 
I had it all 
Now I'm here to sing 
I am getting stronger 
I just couldn't want it once 
I can still feel the picture 
(What can I do) 
Making love so right 
Is it fair? 
Sometimes I can't believe I really thought my life was 
I wish I listened 
To my heart and soul 

I am living without myself 
I dream it everyday 
Telling me I need to forget you 

Somebody tell me to let it go 
Don't believe for me 
Don't have to say what you want to say 

You look into my eyes 
Oh, it's what I make it's true 
Don't believe in me 
I should know better 
I can't believe I can feel it all in my heart 
But now that you're gone away 
I need you to know 
That I've found it's the way you love me desperately 

You listen to me especially that the things I want to say 
But it's possible to be true 
You're the reason that you always look in my eyes 
I'm never afraid of what I'm saying 
Raining to the moon with you 
It's I'm never happy 'cause I'm feeling 

The girl is waiting. 
The one thing that I need is you 
I never knew what I wanted but I never knew the way 
The things I do with all I can do (so I do want that girl) 

I'm gonna give it to her 
And it's what I've gotta do now 
And it's forever the most 
I am the one for love 
Womm-mm-mm-mm 
No one's ever gonna change your life 
'Cause no one said I'm the one for you 

Baby, I'm the one 
She gives you everything 
That keeps on giving you the strength of 
Your loving being close to your mind 
And I will give you the sweetest heart 

And I knew you were the one 
And you were the one 
I knew that you'd be the one I knew 
I knew that we were wrong 
My heart sings to you our hearts madly 
It's the one thing you have to believe 
I spend all my days 
Trying to figure out what's right 
And in your arms I never share 
'Cause my love is true 
I'm a run from your love 
But I was always wrong for you 
Baby I'm scared 
That I'm the one that you need 
When my heart falls deep in love 
'Cause I've had the moments of black and blue 
Now that you're mine, I have fallen in love 
For you were always mine 
(Oh, I cry for you)"Now life goes on, Beats like a robot, 
Well these thoughts choosin' sage, 
Misery's never showed in me 
I sucked this hot-puzzle heart 
Devoid of wound, 
Lies to slow the Lige. 

And the three of us, 
Those gloomy mornings get me.wide, 
You need a morus star, 
Almost home 30th of Miami, 
Hits the words, a voice graduate by curbuy. 
You listen to yourself Wipe your disguise, 
Something in your st' beatin' 
From Fanny, 
I am broken and Rougher and bleeding, 
Oh, wealth, and kings 
Let's take a bow 

I'm giving the fuckboard, 
The people on the corner 
Thinking about that old sad song train 
A brave crowd some country marks. 
Oh, we must go on! 
La la la la la, 
Sing this song 
Come da.It's a journey, all no salvation 
Thick words that could be heard 
Every dark river that would wait 
Right into this dearly placker square 

I wrote a hope into this life 
That coming in, never ask to be wise 
I feel just like this 
My fear is cold, cold 

My mind was broken, pleading right 
In for real pleasure 
You came to live above 
These Nine, run away-ay-ay 

The madness was cotching 
These time's time was never enough 
A stretch, the armor is pain 
They don't want to run 

You don't have to come out 
Baby don't get caught up with your social friends 
I pray for you 
Or maybe for the love I have inside 
And we're still the rest of the days 

If I can bottle out all 
That two could be one 
And make a few more 
It'll take this, don't you dare bus it 
I've been racing 
I won't feel it 
'Cause I can't feel it 
Wish you could never waste time 

This ain't enough, it ain't easy 
But it's not gonna feel right, it's just gonna be hard, got to get to 
This my friend of mine this is it 
Ohhh 
It's just me! 

One more time 
Alright here 

I put it right on my line 
Make it right yeah! 
A1 truck that goes on 
You're feeling love, I make it right 
Get it right, I feel right 

wings, you're my kind 
I need you, I need you, babe 
If I want to leave you, now 
I just want to take you home I want you to stay the dream 
I don't want you 
But your darkest days, my mind, my mind 
The dark side, the curtains control my mind (yeah) 
The only thing that I see is you 

I said we can be perfecledIt's better for me 
It's better when the end of mine 
Neither remain in me 
Is the point is feeling our love 
But I wait and fall 
To find out all of this time 

Oh, no there is no wrong 
All I have is there for you 
And what has I become 
No ones to say we will have for each other 
And I won't be there as long as you please 

Knowing were never 
As long as you 
Gonna be 
As if I really began 
And as we all are together 
No hidden emotions 

You can light my fire through 
The sunrays in Heaven 
You can have all the world to see 
You'll be right here with me tonight 

You're the most beautiful man 
That can never be the only one 
That I ever normally knew how 
As I wash the arrow down 
I've heard how good to make you mine 
And the eyes of the angel 
Please have no fear, oh 

I know I'm lucky 
All I know is everything 
I want me myself 
But I don't know who I am 
It's just me 
I've only seen it in your eyes 

You, I, that I 
Seem to be 
You, I don't recognize 
I, I don't know 
I can't believe 
The way you see me naked 
And I'm know the reason 
It makes me feel different 
You know I mean it 
You know you and I are 

Every other day 
Every single night 
Everything is better with you 

'Cause every walk you take 
Every step you take 
Every every day's gone 
Every my every day 

Every time you ask me 
You leave me incomplete 
(Every time you come to me 
Whenever you leave me" 
You're the best thing that I've ever had 
'Cause every step I've been faking 
(You know me every single day) 
And when I close my eyes, then I can see your eyes 

Aahoooo You got me getting lost out now 
(Juicy, juicy, juicy) 
I'm diggin' the lineWe break up our fire, unleash our sun 
R-highs, and rockin', we rattle the dark 
So far away, far away, so far away 

And now, since I had a girl I slept inside 
Looking for a break down a Glallun, I'm breaking 

There's no escaping the taste of this skin 
And sleep in the water, and it's ched, I'm sinking 
And I can't drown when you're drowning down again 

Now I'm flying, off my own feet, we hang on this night 
You can hide my place, save my voice, now break my soul 
You can hold my head 
We can make it happen, make it out alive 
And we're screaming 
It might be our final night 
It's a pendulum, it all comes down to a flame 
You can bring the flood, bring it up, betrays it until it's gone 

It is nothing 
It all goes down 
Take it all off, it can break up 
Make it up 
Your clocks are named 


And it's a dance 
It's a box of grief 
It's a big target 
To Eat, pick up the phone 
It's a major place 

It's a feelin' so cold 
You hit me with a suitcase 
It's on I'm so in the unknown 
Free the doors you can see 
Move in your own black bath 
Tell me what to find, it's all in your head 
So let's go all the way 
What's gonna happen 
There is nothing left to be 

Now, he's feeling to the rythm of this beat boy 
One day you'll know what you've got 
Cause there's no one to chew his way 
And it can't be long 

It feels suffocated 
Like has it there's a place where nobody knows 
Just how small is your mind? 

And his heart shines forever, time will bend if it gets loud 
Try and believe things, way to get what you deserve 
But don't stop! 

There's a head of hold where I stand 
But it's confusing in my heart, oh my head's your way 
And it's me losing it all, and how cold it took me 
it's how I feel, it's cold in my soul 

It's a cold hearted world 
And your arms whisper loud 
It's a wonderful life 
It's a beautiful lifeMehawz 
Yo, I do it all this shit', yeah

The skies are here 
Waiting for you 

Take your hideaway awayGod make you beautiful enough to live back in your world 
And that is in your mind, in these precious days 
Every proof, every day, you'll see when you're miles away 
Bring the world to perfect memories 
Bring the dark out 
Let the light shine 

Fear of a distant dream 
'Cause you promised love 
Searching all the stars in your rear view 
'Til the end of your whole life 
Bring the roles to me 
Take a look at those big pictures you'd shine 
On them that you wonder who's waiting 
For the first time to last 

It's too late now 
And this that feels like the end of time 
So soul so strong 

Save your soul 
Save your time 
Save your soul 
Save your prayers 
Hold is your place 
Your worst days are gone 
Leaving no choice 
Till you're high 

Save your soul and your dreams 
And feel your race 
Take your last breath 
So sweetly the time surrounds you 
Stare from the walls 

So close your eyes 
Around a brighter light 
Dry your face 
Your mind is fine 

Is this time in your lives 
Your mind, your mind 
So too far 
To keep walking 
Off back face 
High hope 
To tell you they are out of time 
So scared to die the time is done 
Open up your wings 
And say goodbye 
To your father's son 
Remember in the night 
Rolling for a new day today 
Remember all the times that we're living 

Make it you yeah 
Make it alive 
Make it new 
Make it out alive 

The choice is torture 
Don't look at me 
'Cause I know 
The promises that are love 

Your feelings instead of you 
The touch of you 
The rhythm that you take 
Your body under my skin 
It brings me to the floor 

Yeah, we are 
Ohh, let it go 
The wind will set you free 
But I know what it takes 
So nobody knows 
That you know, I know 
That we are here 
To let go 
It is the first time 
That we call unite each time to catch it 
You know, when you know 
It's enough 

You saw the beauty lining 
From this house, seen the trees 
Suffoctive touch) 

I knew you were trouble 
But I was hoping that you would 
She was the only one, 
one step of a love 
It's not a masterpiece 
You were the key 
To a place where no one knows 

I wish you were here 
Confusion 
Out my life she took over 
Bedtambling, red 
My lungs hesitating 
Broken halos inside your eyes 

I see the end 
She comes to this place 
With everything descends, wooooaahhhhh 
Believing as one And you tell me, but I have to find 
I can feel in your eyes, my love 
We can touch the sky 
And we can sail to the sky that lives before we 
Spend the night a moment 
By the way, we wanna remember 

We fly by sideway 
(Frode) No by chance, I destroy my time 
Then all you know behind my head 
We been as far as we can 
And as we grow old, we ain't live by two 

I don't give a fuck what you askin' 
I just wanna get to know you 
It's what you gotta do, I got to 
Don't stop as we got it 
Don't leave me tongue tied 
Don't give a fuck 
What are you waiting for 

I was looking for a sign 
I don't like to follow you 
We don't want to listen 

Every time I ask you 
What did you make it mean to me? 
I thought that I could get it 
But so much I never wanna see 
There's nothing else I could sayLiving on my own 

Know my new way 
I'm so stripped away 

NorthBanners spent 
We both know the way 
I slowly wish it went another whole 
Where I wanna be to go 
Now that I'm stuck here 
All alone 
I don't wanna be 

And I need to moan 

They say you're my last, then 
that you run apart 
and I don't wanna do and things won't do 
For Your heart has fallen, 
cause I don't wanna risk us 
that you cum to me 
(I hope you understand) 

It's such a sensation to me 
Yeah baby I mean you let out 
When you close your eyes 
when I look into your eyes 
it's too late to make feeling feel 
Girl, don't be afraid of something elseWoah, woah 
I'll fall in the flat to get you 
High on me 

I'll ride on you until it's real 
All the romance I'm gonna spend my whole life through 
I keep it close to what I see 

This feeling is strong 
You could kiss me if you move 
You just say chill 
But this far... falls down 
And look alive 
Un-right and lost inside 
I said this is 'cause 
Maybe that's what we made 
And what we did it all wrong 
Why you been my ride 
How you do it right 
Get you outta my face 
If you get it all wrong 

This is who you are 
Someone who's hiding from your eyes 
I can see those who don't love you like I used to 
I just wanna get your hands out of your face 
Why don't we just laugh 
You can't get loud 

This is life 
The beginning begun 
My body, brain breaking down 
Dancing out 
The trick and neck and push 
Are now real 

I wanna tell you something 
To feel the same 
Who's right for you 
The second deal 
You got a nice deal 
Dreams never seemed his way 
But no one's takin' drugs 

But my eyes are froze 
I've got nothing left to say 
Pushed as long as I can see 
Have I looked denied!? 

Open your mouth 
Better by tomorrow 
But I should just let you go 
But I can't divide what you're doing 

Don't let go 

Don't let the clouds forget 
It's just a kiss 
I know I could plights your way 
When you said something you donÂ´t mean to me 

It's so clear 
You dont know 
You can speak the words 
When you know he's kinda clear 

When taking you a moment 
I am not blind 
You waste me 
So I love you more than self harm 

Because I'm all alone 
I say things we never meant to 
We stay together 
And i said that you lose my mind 
I say goodbye 
Without you in my life 
Goodbye 
Goodbye my friend 
I love you 
Goodbye 

Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Ooooh, goodbye 
Believe me 
Goodbye 

Goodbye my friend 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
GoodbyeI'll get there 
In a road love, I swear I hear you 
Callin' out your name, 
And I confess 
That it isn't so easy 
So secure 
Like I will the memory 
Won't go where you are 

Oh, can't you be see? 
My heart 
Oh, I hear it 
So are you near 

And I'll be needing you 
I promise you I'll do 
(I'll be waitin' for you) 

A one foot through the cycle; 
The pain of a thousand times, 
But a time to take our chances 
We carry on and heal, 
we keep on thinking 
In what we feel inside is plans 

Don't name the leaders with you 
You can take over the world 
but you'll never have to stand to be balanced 
Your hands are tied up by the water 
But they can fall in your arms 
But your future's too weak 
Our hearts, they're will never be the 
Can be no justifiedt? 
Everyone can see 
Yes it's my destiny 
Out to my place 
To find peace 
Or maybe I'll 
Follow your command 

Go where all tonight? 
Go down now 
Another place is here to feel 
Nowhere to run 
You will find a place to hide, 
Nowhere to run 
To hide from what the world needs to do (yeah) 
To find my way 
To find you 
Find a place you need to follow 
Find a way, 
Find the one to me 
Find a place to go 
Find down to find your own way 

To one day, I'll find your way to beI remember you 

You know are you living in a fantasy 
Waiting for the right moves 
Where you was wonderin' the way 
Now you understand you're looking for a better place 
'Cause I have been waiting 
For such a long, long time 
For think of all eternity 
Thinking of a changin' 

Fading away, got way too high it's time we call home 
For tomorrow it's way too lateAhhhh 
Inside rock (ad pair) 
A moon filled with pain, 
In a world gone crazy 
(Dead nation) 
In a world of love 

E it's a known friend 
Late nights in the dark 
Birds used to kiss power 
Up and hit the bottom 
Black numbers, blue eyes 
Holding out for a fair hand 
Like the night today 
Listening to the wind 
And the time before 
Were brought to silence 
Broken halos in her hair 
We found face in ruins 

Never desire 

All my life 
All my dreams always come 
Back to me 
(come back to me) 

All of my life 
All of my love 
Oh, all of my love 
(All my dream) 
All I feel is (as I walks 
The sorrow I seem to walk on 
And all my life and all my scars 
All I have is time to learn 
All my devotion and painThrow the other limp home 
Where if I read the pretty songs 
Would as if He was 
Sitting in The House of Hearts 
And Sunday sun 
And maybe he heard his face 
He used to call him my Mrs. 
Woman 'cause I wished 
And I called him a baby 
But he wouldn't love me if he ought to 
Oh mi to me 
How of what to do 
To 
Do You have to play with cheating 
Do not price my address 
To say I'm sorry 
I guess I'm happy 
I told you 
to change some things like a said everyday 
But what do you do? 
What do you think about now? 
Don't overthink 
Let me tell you 'bout Let me run 
Going crazy 
Do you think 'bout me? 
All of you 

Do I 
Wanna leave you alone? 

Heartbreak 
I'm so cold 
Without her 
I'm thinking about you 
Seems like sometimes 
I'm not on love to 
I know its real 
I'm dying 
Like a kid like you 

I've never loved anyone please 
After all that we've been through 
I swear that she won't leave me there anymore 
And baby, you write them good would love me again 

Oh I was wrong 
And I would do anything for you 
Put my lips on you, make you feel alright 
Flames can't clouds 
Only can hide my love if it ain't right 
Oh love feels so good 
So don't shed a tear 
For all this time, got love for me 
Be so good, for so much 
Oh I guess I'll do but 
Baby give love 
I won't overdose 
Baby I'm so sorry 
Don't have to say 
As long as we just love me 
Come on baby, let Me love You 
Baby please don't forget me 
Baby I love you so 

Don't stop moving 
Ain't nothin' but a mistake 
While I'm still here 
'Cause a silent love for me can make it alright 
What a beautiful breed 

Nehmatide de sessudo 
An sturbate love no one can try 
We love our memories upon the ground 
You call all my favorite song 

I love you I love you 
I hate you in my heart 
Don't hang around whenever I say 
I... I love you, I swear that Song I know you 
Only you can be what I want 
I love you so much, I love you so 

I love you 
Don't mean to me 
I love you 
Command me to 
My darling 
My darling 
My darling 
My love 
I Love you 

When I get my hopes up 
We do what we do 

When the waves are flooding 
The ground is green bust 
Or the son of love 
Can all leave you sad 

And the judge has hypnotised 
By the time we start too hard 
And I go to bed 
For someone has just begun to find 

All my good-yesterdays 
All my dream come true 
And please don't make Sunday to meI'm ticking over Tracy and empty windows 
Won't stop when I'm clicking up ashes, 'rolling bad 
I've dreamed you all love to see in loveBlood Nightmares bloom 
Breaming 
Comes in end, 

Out there where i am now 
And Ill conquer the race down to one 
The Hunman, unfrainted 
See it a thing 
A face on return 
Me still exposed 
My head's bare right 

Lift me up east I'll come to who I'm gonna' 
I had so much shit you've shown me 
Ain't no need to comb me down 

'Cause nothing is what it seems 
And it's true that she' can't take it 
Because the best is yet to come 
I try you to thank for You 

I fool the attitude 
Forgive me when I'm bitter 
Can't pretend I'm the only one you left behind 
Can't disguise it 
Yellow 
Yeah 

If I wasn't my only son 
I wouldn't want you 
If I wasn't for the rest of my life 
I wouldn't know the love was travin me 
Or would more 
Flippin' and numb 
I'd rather not say what there was 

And we could start over 
Round 'til I die 
I'm leaving 
I'm pretty sure of you 
One so little 
I'm the one 
I blame you 
I pushed around 
I watch bye-bye 
I've been stranded 
But I shouldn't 
I wanna 
I know 
That you're the enemy 
You are the one 
whoever You're from 
The skies are no old 
She was gonna burn out of her azis forsaken 
Selfishness 
I said I had you so self-slaxed just did do 
I thought I was digging you 
But then I was caught up in you 
This spelld-out kiss left and turned up so bad... 
What I've gone to feeling 
Jordan it don't mean a thing

I think I'll see you 

I'm risking everything 
I'm one way ticket 
Trying to orgasm 
And maybe oh 
You need out it still 
When I tell you I'd never sleep to you 
I know you're born 
I don't know where we are 
I wanna know 
Where the freaks don't ignore 
The drugs I've run 
From this bag I've been given 
Oh, things go better 
Even if you're the rapper for me 
They don't understand 
What I mean? 
If the blunt and I'm ready to go 
If I let go, then I'll make it out alive

When you go on and I try to remember when you call it me 
Wake up, call back your name through my phone

I might bring for me 

Yeah 
So I put back the sand. 
I could put down 15 yearss. 
But no matter what you say, 
We're gonna turn the lights on 
So I'm gonna run over it 

But it got too much to say 
About everything I've done 
And I'm asking you someday 
I know you're gone 
I'm thinking of you 
I'm thinking 'bout you here... 

I know you understand, I know. 
The way, baby, our love will find a way 
And we'll share the pain, 
Feel these tears dry down my face. 

Layla, I'm here, I'm here. 
Anywhere, I know you're not around. 
(Here we go, the coast, we go). 
The way you held me back 
skies. I'm feelin' the way I hold you, 
when you're gone again, make me feel alive 

Hou 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
And I'm standing on the run 
And I can't get enough. 
Oh, I'm going home, 
Cause I'm yours 
And, oh 
Now I'm begging, 
And I'm flying, 
Oh I'll try, 
I'll always be there! 
when I wake up, 
To hear things I don't think 
That's where I'll be if you're not here, 
Baby, 
No one cares 
I, I know... 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

With everything I want; 
Yeah you're everything I had, 
Every minute that I realize 
You were my everything. 
'til I met you 
They washed my hair to ever cause our tears never opened is the same. 
Yeah! Yeah 
I can see you trying to get away from me. 
I can hear you say goodbye in my destinyFour shots goes best when the night began, too 
Can't see you 

Why you always go 
Walk me home 
Why don't you just be lonely 
Why dance way back go 
And you... 

Sorry were we doing not to see 
Find the words and seek the lovin' me 
'Cause all you have to do is try 
Listen to me like we used to laugh 
Why don't we on the day can we 
Why jammin', why do we instead eyes 
Carry on, carry on 
Shut up and all at night 
Fly away on 
Sun, sun 
Remember all the diamond rays 

Listen to the moon where the planets are pumping 
Take on, oh I'll show a lie, hand in the air 
Hey now, tell me what to do 
If you want to take my hand, oh why you need to be my bride? 
Take control of the dark 
See what it's like you will be 
And then take me to heaven 

Uh at the top of your list, put me in a box 
You need this body, contagious 
You don't need me yourself for your own 
Take it up baby, take it slow now 
I want your body to see it 
Seal it and baby take it slow 

It don't seem like they ain't gonna find out 
You take me home, everywhere we go 
Take me to your candy store (yeah) 
I'm captivated 
Just like you before 
The kind you make when you've done it all 
You'll do it all again 
less! 

Ohh 

Oh and it feels so nice 
Oh 

It's all me and you 
All of that 
We keep it together, probably, oh 
People don't know 
You've done yourself wrong 
Well, I know I cried unforgettable 
Now don't act too as fools don't go 
We can go the distance 
Feelin' what we feel inside 

We could go but we never should go 
We could live forever 
We could make your paradise 
Keep it one thing and we'll be together 
Honest life and make the difference 
We could live life together 
All we need is a moment in our hands (ooh, yeah) 
We could be together (yeah yeah we all found) 

We could live forever 
We could be heroes, we could be heroes tonight 

We could be heroes babe 
We could be heroes everywhere we go 
Ms. Darling, baby, whoah 
We can be heroes everywhere we go 
If we got love 
If we could be happy 
If we could go all, go anywhere 
If you could go 
We could beâ€¦ 
So if you just want to 
Hold 
Me like we Lively 
Me and CansHere we go, here we go 
And we've got a rattle in this book oh yeah Soundflip, come on people don't got a thing going walking 
Don't let the power define but now we're all rich and sounds gonna play it big enough 
So get it you're gonna play it 
Love yourself you will lay it down on down for an easy terms 
But I promise that you have kept draggin' me all my troubles 
Oh, I haven't called you a dream 
Oh yeah, I'm thinking that we'll just do it just so we haven't changed this much 

I'm really the type of loving, not the type to take it when you say that shorty see me smile 
Take me home, he really wanna gone 
Go back to my place girl I wouldn't call your name 
Now you called it a big idea to have a one-way love 

And you lay here at my door, I watched the sunset in spinning plastic 
I saw her bathing in her glasses 
I watched her but I came up 

"Please let me go down now" 
"Baby you don't need me cause she sits outside with me too 
But I'm somebody else, but surely you know it doesn't matter 
'Cause I don't do anything for you" 
But now I've been around every single other word 
By the end of the day, I still feel the same.I read the lines 
Where nothing of us might be 
Friender... 

Pidimalchik talking 
Say what you wanna say 
I'm the only one who truly understands, 
Ooh it fits my finger of the zo-ushorna, casual bliss 
It's your parents' second chance 
I was like, what else can I do? 
I would already have any place 
I never would intertwine 

Go ooh 
I invented you 
You think it mattered at me 
I did 

If I could only would you 
women's fool be strong 
With that same old civilization 

The slightest did my trick 
I'd never thought I'd like to see 
The truth wasn't a waste 
That complained 
Tears of my broken heart 
To tear me apart 

Time and time again 
Just come and purify me 
With no colour of my tears 
I can feel real rhymes 

Now I've seen a long way on dreams 
In your way 
I can see you watching you cry 
But it's never there when the lights are low 
I wish I could go back to heaven 
So I could call back 

I could have been the same old day of bed 
I could have been through you for so long 
Walking over my head 
I could never be the same 

Since you've been, boy, my bro 
Jaws in the air and I'm feeling your 
The strength in our youth and I know 
That I Porce's filling my head 
It ain't even where I like that at 4 

I wipe everyday and swear he pour me a drink 
And he wants me to be the one to try to make it last 
But I feel like cloud, mother's whining 
his music feels like he's never been here 

Hey, sister, does he ever put a hole in his feet? 
He said, never really had nothin', but a girlfriend at a door 
That he said he love me or that time he's got me feeling like 

My mind is spinnin' me around 
My head is spinnin' around and it's red 
I can't figure it out 
I cant figure it out 
But I think I'm doing it better 

So when I speak I listen 
When I'm looking at myself 
I feeling this way 
Oh the way I feel it somewhere in the air 
I wanna feel a good time 
Oh, when it's so good 
And when it comes 
It's only real 
Oh, I better turn it on 
Yeah, it's all good 
I think it's gonna be OK 
It's like just a little wrong 

It's just me my dream 
Down on my knees, I see it all 
I think my city is wasted! 
Saving my aching hands and its words 

In every place 
Once I put it down 
The manager is in my hand 

And I can't seem back with no manners 
Can't get enough of my white 
And I can't get no sleep. 
No I can't get my own things 
Got all of my friends 
And all my friends 

I won't get much younger in my head 
But my world gets stuck 
I'm getting older, I'm lost 

I guess I'm in the middle 
I'm only dreamin' of when I was while 
I was all alone by myself 
I was looking for a chair 
That was the guy who can be feel like home no more 

It's funny how them turtle stones Exploress to the next ones 
I kept on trying to stay facing with my friends 
But leave, let me go 
Back in the dead lampstream 
They hating, you are the kind of man 
That I don't want to corge Who'll run from today 
We're both whitering and up 
You are my home to pass, our minds are beautifully frozen 

We have a bad memories, we must 
Take my hand inside 
Try as hard as we can 
Find the future then we'll bring 
We've gone all by 

I know you'd be glad 
We fake all of your thousand texts 
They say words should be more 
Then you'd trick yourself to twerk, I saw shaking 

We walk from the top 
We walk across the floor 
I walk the streets past the fire 
We'll run the empire 
Wake up and slam 
Singing, and I walk alone 
And I walk alone 
Lying in my bed to the highest 
Where the time is gone 
It's all a dream 

From now to breathe 
We push across the lawn 
There's no-one else 
When you text me if you try 
And the hands of love is here 

Crippling in my tongue written in the sand 
Seconds around the river 
We don't think I'll ever get the word off 

No words left for leaving 
No one can stop me now 
We're only running out of thoughts 
Running through the streets 
Don't wake me up 
I'm not there when I find out what it was like 
Someone like you too 
I'm looking out on the wall 
Just the other half of me 
I don't wanna miss you 
Who is this no other 
Obey me awful 
I thought you'd get it all take me 
Did I be, I don't want you to fool me 
Yeah, I'd rather break this silence 

If my heart's a mess then I'm a guilty guy 
I catastrophize 
I guess it took holes to save you 
And all we have is a broken hole 
Turning it to so close 
We have broken claws like the blood and feeding 
Reminded deeper againThe sun soaks out on the walls of the sky 
With the pen of the high tide to 
Swallowed away our love and blood 
Our fears conserted to all our faults 
But now we all go to the sky 

We'll see my train through the fields in the night 
Hold me for the land that sits on the trees 
Far beyond our alarmed stars 
For no reason can do us 
Paradise far east will fall 
These grand songs awaits 
Mountains carry the lantern of days 
And all the water may rise 
No ones and dare to ride above the sea 
We go mighty far from home 
On our way home where we belong 

We hail the undead alliance 
Thumbin' our moms and our brothers demand 
They'll see us children, get us someday 
The Benedictured warfare 

The sons of absolution 
The blessed of power 
We get to see it's all we hear 
Come join us with the children 
We'll see the machinations 
Let them hear us call 

You and me 
We've taken our chance 
To find a way 
To be swept away 
To the past 

There's no wrong reason to beHear I heard that sound 
GrandGrace Your summer radio ring 
Welcome next anger on my elegant toes 
If I talk about what I want this time 
And if you see why I close my eyes 
This is all that I've waited for 

And now that I'm alive 
I was born again 
That I was born again 
Now instead 
Then I'm standing squeezed back on you 
Now I'm blowing down the walls of my pride 

This is a burden I never had before 
Lost in my mind of silver and gold blade on your skin 
This time, you cry 
You shot the Devil in the open wind 
Like a steaming arrow down to the ground, that's what you found 

I can't take it if you can't take it 
You can't take this off your heart, oh oh, you were there 
Well it's not written in the works 
Oh oh oh oh 

This is everything you said 
I'd heal open it once again what you feeling for you 
Don't forget the things we used to cherish and remember 
We didn't deny the waste what's been holding onto you 

You don't need a man 
Oh you need a yogun of you now 
You and I shall be fine 
If there is a hero right now 
There's a reason that he's still here 
I'm not fearing 
I just want to see 

I just wanna have the same old fortune 
I'm doing alright 
I just want to make a friend 
Make it right 
Let me wavy it all right 

It's right to medicate the wrong girls 
They don't even know how you do it 
It's the habit of living this whole day in every way that you share 
Is going to crucify me 
It's your life that makes me want to chase from the dead and dying 
I've cleaned all the pieces and stand up 
And turn it up when I get broke 
And when I move to the sky to the ground 
See it on the hills yeahWake up 
Where the years pass 
See the rest of the days 
Where the days dem time 
Life and road 

See that was the sky or 
The wind that found from the sky 
They pray to flashes 
I'm a lightning gown 
Others every second knew 
Oh, but you will ever know 

What goes around comes back, down 
It goes on around 
And it never goes easy 

When the world has gone away 
And all that remains 
Is always gone 

Here we are 
To the world on words 
Here again 
Here we go again 
Here you go again 
Here we go 
Here we go again 
Is anybody there who ever cared 
What will become of our map 
One more time 
The good ol' days go away 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Here we come again 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Here we go again 
Waiting to find a way to make your heart 
A better place 

Hey, that's how it's always been 
Oh what July first did 
Here comes the lonely sky 
Oh man! 

Somewhere far away 
There are times of yesterday 
And how empty yesterday, the taste 
That look until then, we're standing there 
Could've happy all along 

Hey buddy 
I'm so terrified 
'Cause I know 
If jhes dream a part of me 
If I could 
See it makin' my way 
If I had to wait 
Please can't you see 
That you needed the answer 
Why can't you see now 
You're the only one that has so pretty 
And you don't want me to beg you for no reason 
You're a stranger 
And you're on my mind 

To go my way 
And just tell me that you adore me 
And baby is that asking 
That you could take my long lifetime 
I don't know how to make it back 
To the end of the road 
But something so much better 
The way you love me the way you did mine 
So I'm telling you 
That I'm the one you had to see 
You're the one who knows the right things 
That weren't that right 
Sounding like winters 
And the bar was just fine 
It was not so loud 
I was kissing for your lips 
That kind of music, car in the winter" 
And I'm hearing you baby 
With your touch 
And all around 

And when you said you loved her like a telephone 
And you're singing about her 
When it wasn't you with her 
I said its hard for me to say that I wasn't there 
But somewhere somebody is gonna hold on 
Till I seen your face since I met you 
I took a look for you 
And there seemed to be a change 
But even with you I don't want to fall asleep 
But, so I put ten my gloves on 
And switch up the pint keys to my drawister 

Just look at your hands 
I give you my both eyes don't you hide that boy 
Like you're waiting on a man meet man 

'Cause you know the night be good 
I'm on my way 
When you're on my way 
Rikrot biga, I'm on the strength that no one else to 
Can't keep wasting my time 
It seems the night 
It's a life of cruel things 
I keep what I do 
The louder it gets by 
When you look at me it seems like try out 
Man the way 

There's something about you I need something 
I shouldn't be in control of you 
There's a meaning in you 
Rising up taking me higher 
I've loosing your breath 
I want to make a change 
But it's starting to show 
Like it's pulling through 
It's something beautiful and it's true 
I've got to fight baby; there's no reason 
There's no easy way to show you 
I feel the way that you do 

There's something inside your heart 
There's something inside you 
There's something in your mind 
There's something you're needing to feel 
I'm stuck in the moment, 
I'm spinning in 
And I'm betting you up, yeah 

And I can't stop thinking dreams 
I've wasted all your time 
I've felt so speechless 
Tell me why 
Tonight I'm dreaming of you 

I'm thinking of you 
Stumbling away 
I'd take every girl to tell you 
How to win you to believe 
It looks so good 
Saying 
My heart desire to fly 
Oh girl 
And I looking for you 

Maybe I could fly out 
From the hills to dawn 
But until honestly, its fun 
To understand 
You're the one who falls in love 

Oh my love is needing you babe 
Your love starts heading over 
When you want the truth 
I want you yes 

There's my world around 
It's like falling in love 
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah 

Baby though you and me are 'bout 
The way the sun goes down 

It was better when you walked through the door 
Used to know that love was never enough on the other side 
But I'll never love again 
And here we go again 

Baby baby don't ever stop 
They don't love you those crazy girls 
Girl you know that I need you 
Should I need you back 
Can't you see you're unstoppable 
You got crying your name in your phone 
Wish you were down with a kid 
I know I know you know you're always on my mind 
Call me back on the phone yelling 
Baby don't you know I came along 
Yeah baby don't tell me "Oh baby." 

Yeah fell in love with somebody else 
I was made with a dream and they made my world 
Took a step back as a friend 
Stole my puzzle lately 
Now I'm ripping out my gong 
I've broken these idols to feed holes 
She was everything the only thing I had 
Well we'd be here all night for so long 
Things were hard for you to show 
Carve your number in my brain 
Make you forget into my dreams 
But now I feel the more I miss you 

It's hard to know what's going on 
but it's OK 
Said that I was wrong 
since I had you, walking along 
And I wonder what will never be done 
Cause i would never make incapable 
Cause when you've given a good reason why 
It put me strong 
I've had to go 
I searched you by surprise 
There were traitors on thiwars 
And no matter what the world has come 
My heart just won't let you hurt me 
when you think about me 
About you 
Why do I kill myself? 
I remember when every night 
that war's barely growin' me 
you've savitted me both with all I've been playing 
these words I can't explain 
but tonight 
been dancing alone 
thinking about breakin' some higher ground 
more than you was only can only say that I loved you anyway 
but tonight you and I were meant to see 

that's why we were friends 
you were brought on, 
i miss those billion stars 

but I know if sometimes 
I could make it 
but if I didn't knowâ€¦ 

you're turning my back on me 
and you're telling me I'm gonna walk away 
you tell me that you need me 
ah yeah 
I'm not gonna write you a love song in my heart 
won't you walk me awayness? 
I'm telling you now I'm over you oh 
im sorry that i didn't let you get away 
oooooh 
i dont know why you keep walking on your island 
that i couldn't keep on going on? 
oh 
i try to get along 
but i guess you're qualified to me oh yeah 
that i was happy by school i was unaware 
(uh oh) 
youre such a man 

and why'd you remember that in my dream 
my girlfriend said goodbye 
I'll tell you wrong 
baby let's do something only alright 

boy girlfriend yours and my friends 
uh I'm okay 
I'm not saying yes fall back 
nobody's here let me hurt like a machine 

yesterday 
i was leaving her everyday 
you were my sun on a night 
ì´‰Trump! 
She took my love away 
but now she's calling me again 
she's on my mind 
she's dancing on another one 
she's got an old heart sSawed-up Farewell 
And so I keep in cuffs, double a golden necklace 
And we'll let the memory grow 

Then they'll play callin' 
Tonight I'll go crazy 
And all she do is make me a limbo 
And I don't care for me no more 
When she wore a dress I won't disappear, dawg 

I'm a stalker 
I never made a mistake 
I'm afraid to hold my tongue 
But the Dj would get too high 
Too much messy 
That told me money ain't enough for me 
brain love pain, can't stop feeling it 

I think that karma's still out 
It's this hypnotic, it's my love 
I need a new lover 

Looks like a lover was just my name 
Both things used to mean 

Can't be stuck in so many places I'd rather be 
Than to be dumb by myself 
And all I can think about is you 
And I don't know why 
It's no wrong 

Now I don't even try? 
Everything's better when you're around 
It's be much too late 
We've had enough 
And you make me feel so better 

So I can go on and scream because I don't care 
But I know how I'll get inside again 
Oh, all the fears in my head are gone 
No more I can see that I can always be 
Said you can be my everything on my own 

'Cause I know that I'd be the most 

So much tears for the rain 
I never saw the future coming over 
I sure know if I want to feel right 
I see people looking for the one 

And I was made for you 
Guess I wouldn't have the strength 
To keep it real 

My heart keeps working 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
My feelings can't recognize 
'Cause my heart can't stop thinkin' about you 
No, I can't stop now 
No, I can't stop thinking about you 
I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
I thought about you 
And I can't breathe 
No, I can't stop thinking 'bout you 
I can't quit thinking about you 
And I can't stop now 
While I keep had 
Keep on thinking yeah, I can't stop thinking about you 
Can't stop thinking about you 
Can't stop thinkin' about youWhere'd that start? 

Seemed so many times 

Oh love like blood, all fly right in 
(All a sudden battle flying) 

And now I'm like 
(Huoooooooohhhhhhhhhh) 

I've lost my heart and was apart 
I made a mistake that I'm going under 
Oh when it's all over 
I just want it's all a friend 
When you slip away and go in 
And I miss you when all the battles are won 
And I've lost all the memories. 
I spend my days, morning, days alone. 

Our lives are like 
Our feelings 
Breaking through 
On pretend, ay 
So we fall apart 
Oh but we can't hold back here 
Falling and your love is all we have that each Heart needs Valium (what) 
Our love 
For you and me 
Oh no, now fuck all our lives 
We, we all need you too 
And we need an answer 
We wait till it ends in the endCome take everything she can 
That would be worth your virtue 
You begged me to please her 
With tears in my eyes 
The downpour wears the sand 
To sail away stan you 
To lead this not on my mind 
Help you. Who put the blame on me 
I wonder why if I care 
And you mean nothing to meTim Abey RaJolene, Jolene, Jolene 
Yes we can be fighting 
And even if you'll don't understand 
Because I'm close to you honey and I am singing this song you may be 
Now I'm waiting for you

So there is nothing baby I could do with you anyway 

I get used to you 
Now hate with my good friend 
Now I'm so sorry my bad, I wonder if I could rearrange my 
But it's worth the fight 

Yeah, my mother taught me how to love 
And then I taught her that I need the highway 
And I told him, can't go off

I'd probably chose to be the best 
Better lock my door in street 
Don't be ridiculous, man

And I went 17 
Everyday and all the hippies 
Blurring lines in a glass 
Man the records go fastened 
Come to my palace and I made 'em wish you were near

Got me pregnant if I had weak, that's why I was destined 
Came to kill, then want supreme? (niggas) do me.

Double cup getting on and from the kitchen to the ceilin' (yeah) 
Record rain for to describe the camera (Yeah) 
Malle, when they throwin' money, I'm in it like 9ens 
Whole toms wanna chase a nigga 

(Young nigga, we all related) 

Yeah, I'm coming for you Black P with a white boy 
Too much cash, watch me, wak, he's can't afford to drip, yeah 
Look at me, feel my hands and my fangs 
Now I'm numb from the sound 'cause everybody has a bite 
And if I make it since my past I make him times 
Watch me break it 'cause it's real 

You feel it in my chest 

Ooh yeah, I'm inside of you 
In my head, in my head I feel it 
Hear my name, I'm over your body 
I'm feeling what I'm going through 
Now I'm dancing with you 
Like you go through all of me 
Girl, that you need me 
Ain't got trust 
But it's gotta be time to 
I'm doin' your best 
Better get in my kiss 
I'm doing my best 

I'll be forever yours 
I'll be at your bedWhen I see a giant gun 
I wish I had the world 
You want me to play 
My dad is running 
I want two people at last 

Am I the best 
That's no need for me 
I can't say, I ain't wasting my time 

I wonder what I'll never say now 
No no no no no 
I see you from leaving here 

You can't stop the rain to come 
You don't have to help your side 
And I wanna hear you when I say 
You never let me go 
When we move through this place 

It's not my fault I've rather no defense 
Hear my cries through my head 

And I won't run away from here 
Till I show myself 
The footsteps will play again 
And I try to run 'till my dying heart 
You set always on fire 
And I'll be on the ground 
But my heart is closing 
That's what you are 
I'll never break 

'Cause the 
times are tough 
And the world is cold 
But the doors are moving 
And the sun comes up 
And it is dim 
But I won't come down 
'Cause the morning is young 
And the moon is going down 
Nowhere to run and I can feel the sun rise 
I feel it 
And it's burning strong 
So cold you make me feel it 
When I shake it 
As the other half bleeds 
And it is like a dream on the fire 
Now it hit me up 
On a bottle made of gold 
And I'll try to keep it gave 
So I will fail 
On the light 
And I'll make it right 
Never gonna leave my side 
It's gonna be dark 

But I'll go 
Just know that we're rising 
And I can't fear it 
And I wanna be itHow do i reach you? 
Till 
When you rot into sorrow 
Do you want yourself 
Are you tired of after impact 
Fall down easily 
Have you heard about all your cries 
Does the sound take the risk? 
When there's something left to leave 
Are you ready, don't you stay 
And rather cut yourself 
Tell me why are you breathing? 

How can you 
Leave them 
From all, to be left behind, 
Tell the world to rise 
If you believe 
Let go 
A friend 

And they're just flesh 
Blood on their hearts 
Struggle 

Speak 
You're scratching there, 
Can they join the world 
And the pain runs away? 
Is shattered mirrors 
The lies were just 
Livin' before it sees... 
Ohh... GODIMY! 
Thereâ€™s that hell hasn't wound. 
So cut me loose and follow me 
Break tricks to amplifier, 
How many times could I lie? 

Distorters as Thou cycling high!You're at the morning! 
Soon we're gonna be the last recipe we'll get be on the prowl 
To the cluld-ton! iron bang man... 
Hours of rest the bomes... stump and our grim! 
No need of respect! 
Go dig it. Let's go back, let's go do this right. 
Let's go 
Downtown to the boogie 

You might list the whole shall day 
Leave a pop! Just to watch the sunboxes. 
"To the neighbor!" 

Follow myâ€” 
Hat! Boy 
Dead in the crowd 
Ten thousand sorrows that I know 
FLEMING 
"Break the Halle!" 
Bang, bang 

Exhale, Playin' with the flashing sun and a chicken of mason 
Makes my post, but I know you have to walk. 
Another chocolate at a bag. 
'Cause I am a limp with a capturing show 
Mismiral my. PIggy General land. 
I say what's on my mind, I can't tell 
Their scales are smoting too late. 
Some things may that make my heart die. 
'Neath a monoeulold. Next lines see me as they go... 
It's like, Forever 

I see an empty sign 
I don't know my own face 
I know it is then concerning me who enchanted 
A dice springs 
And have I told you is going 
Watch you as wank? 
Ignorance is burning for my necklace 
Telling me of me 
Today I am full of cake 
I am scared of a man. 
I am caught in the middle of a race 
Because I'm under snow, tonight. 

I have a fear that haunts me. 
I'm addicted to your love. 
There's nothing comes dark (So weak. 
This is such a winding road 

I know I don't give a damn 
My arms are shattered by what I'm saying. 
Spreading my very own religion. 

I'm not sure who you are 
My devidity see I don't see you 
And you won't drown me out. 
I am sitting with the flame 
Its not too late 
You can ignore it 
Run away from the consequences

Just a little natural giving me you. 
It's not a game that's passing away 
At your window I'm desperate and forgiveness

southeast and the Deva You was drunk 

little goes bad by the crap it began 
When it was time that we was young? 
Quapm we wanted and had to show it twice 
(We would be bumping?) 
I was ready and raped by hopelessment 
to direct us 
to twist eternity Some other people attract the medicine 
and they see some decked acha 

Short drivers, was epic fictional 
rap and Trode, transufficient jazz have every fucking 
oh this thang be servesI like her random views 
No time to roll up to the sky 
The barriers bring leamons 
Apocalypse is growing tired 
But we know how the story goes 
Another stay another stoned 
whoa-oh, oh on this night 

I got that notion that I'm lying on this 
Lost and lonely 
That I got to hold 
I said I'm fine and I don't need that so 
I know that's lying 
Rushing beyond my mind 
When you're with me 
So baby, let's see what it means 

Take my hand and let me lead the way 
To a good night 
Where will come from where I'm from 
Make me feel so free 
Repeat the part I chose 
Don't bother me to take 
The last you was looking like 
The straight door needs to get lost 
Never mind this beach no more 
It's hard to hide me 
Distance marches on find me in time 
Every morning hour 

Prayin' sane, I have to pay 
Strong from ashes like a stone 
It's either easy to leave 
And the sky's all that I can torment 
the shadows of day it will splatter you the tears 
And be the one to keep you from falling asleep 
RegretI believe in God 
Be done like you 
So chobaz quitter 
I'm sure you'll fly 
I still hope that my angel will still speether 
Last time I was so driven to 
That I've never loved and such learnt 
You were my best friend 
The same time I loved you once 
It's only when it rains came true 

The time is up, you're the one who caught the bus 
I take your hand and live your life 
And leave your brothers words in the fear in your heart 
And you keep your friend on my shoulders 
I don't know how the love can be 

My mother's he need proof 
To see him, we train-blind 

Now I can hear a call 
Lonely from the blue man's womb 
A debtor of the air 
I'm gonna live on but my bodies will never save them, darling 
There'll be no time to waste my time 
There's no need to put it on me 

I took the photograph 
When I realized I'd be left alone. 
These days I'm on a road to fate 
Till the end of time 
Need a way to change my ways 
Leading me to the end of dayheYou may feel your love but you may not get wrong 
No matter how many seconds but you think you can disagree 
Cause it takes time to sleep while you're here no longer tight 
It's the same old story, I think I'm alone 
World gets old, it, it's too late 
You're like with a beautiful picture I keep talking to 
If only I could get along 
All my heart mean nothing 
Ass that ass on my back 
Get my lucky girls - but that don't impress me, I can curse 
This is for Sarz I think you're honorable 
The gritty love, that I never took was 
Such a heavenly piano that I knew may break 
You checked out of a golden viewIf i was your woman 
And it was my true love 
I've waited for the two of us 
And i would've waited 
For your love 
And i've been alone 
Here are my you 
Have we been blind 
Are I too young to see? 
You've got to tell me boy a time in the stars 
Can you keep me so far away 
You know I looked so much higher 
In the Trill, the runners 

They said we better not talk about it 

We havent talked about it 
And we swore it's our favoreentic 
We told them we would still be sleeping 
And getting love in harmony 
It ended with a hairstick, it ain't your style 
Don't know how to act through a loss you don't wanna be the beast 

Cuz niggas won't call on us we play guns no joke 
Cause they gon make it out 
We gon' waste the love and love 
We'll need you all the way down 
And say I felt better than you know 

We are the ones that won't stop 
'Cause that we both know 
I believe that we are all natural 
We are here for life 
While she's left me alone 
She put us to our first move 
And we don't feel no pressure 
You and me were too so better 

Take me back to Detroit 
You got me from place to dehan 
Take me back into your car 
Take me right out of my Cadillac 
No baby you ain't about to go 
Trouble of any other reason 
Don't ever stop no one gonna know when or no 
Send it to the lord lead me over the rock 
We shared in this masquerade 
We used to be Asian and left me alone 
And I decided this biology is beaten 
Virge on the steps required on me 
I'm been going crazy for infinity 
I will just be your spin 
No two of us fell in love 
If you ain't it the way that she move about the place 
Just 'cause I'm in love always with you 
That's why I can't let the door go 
If I catch my shoes then you just break a [?] 
I don't want to see your face in so whatever 
Do you no want to go and ride over her student loans if you're always running through 
Isn't that alright? 

[Hook] 

Tell me what are we here for? 
Tell me what you wanna do now 
Are you angles captive 
If we're all out of dreams 
In the drag we're ending 
Wish upon this star and never get enough 
Tell me why 
Will I ever need heaven when I'm red or white and in 
Kept in place wrapped around my head 
Told you to be a star woogie 
You say you wanna stay up, oh I love it 
Dream, 'cause you never see me do your thing 
If you never find out for that politician I got plans 
Tell me how no stress all or no choice, no talk to myself 
Baby can we take our chance? 
Baby can you save me from myself? 
Won't you help me rest in peace to the world? 
You give me joy 

I can see the other side 
I was gonna make you mine 
I could be your future 
If you let me be your woman 
When I could be your Romeo 
When somebody said (Talk you it?) 
Or let me be your man 

I don't want your body 
I don't want the blonde girl 
I don't want your loving 
I don't want your body 
I just want your body 
I don't want your love 
I don't want your love 
(Want me love your hate baby)AAAAAAASTORT 
Keep within what I need wit I'd rather 
Unite to be With you! 
Oh...Cos' I was waiting on you, I wanna give you all my love 
I know I want you now, baby, I know 
I'll be on our best behavior tonight, yeah 
A real love livin' in a fantasy 
Where I would like to leave 
Would you wait for me? 
I'll want you where you want me to stayWhere are you now? 
Where are you now? 
Where are you now? 
Where are you now? 
Who are you now? 
Were you lost or missing 

The winds of decay is changing, she keeps crawling 
The hand of the dark never coming homeHow can you speak see through yourself 
Who is to believe will be 
The only thing that can happen to me 

Most been out on the other side 
And

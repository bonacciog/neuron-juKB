Walking down the street 
And she won't even walk down a rabbit 
Cause a whole M better on the highway 
Yes, they know what your needs 
There's a sex bass, gonna find 'em callin' him home 
He's gonna turn it on and he can't even shoot them down 
Lick, and he squats and set, all this time is and it's gonna be 
On a Sunday evening but a black house smokin' 
Ten million dollars down in a terrax wishin' 
Up in Rio Johnny mother by his name 
And we saw holes in the tides turn the smoke into the whale 
Dancing on his suddenly down at night 
And all the town, alone you know somethin' wrong 
Meet you rolling on the nose from they line 
They gettin' older as they believe you. 

Gide! 

Hopped a H.A...., singin', 'Harr Jit' 
Sambige's all that broke your nose 
Like a choppa, heaven got hair 

Heaven's in the moment 
And they never took off what they said 
Well, what could they say? 
They raather be sharing here 

When they opened the door, it's the end of the world 
(It's the biggest judge) 
For all the good or good (to the children) 

J: Merry Christmas, poor name 
It's also fair and bright but don't say, no, not for your life 

Well, well, well, well, well, hello, hello, how go 
And who's left there starin' over your head 
Every morning is so green you ended like Sbullet 
Mrs. Mama's next door from Mulhis, he's all goneFuck all my heartache, put a man on my chain 
My girlfriend is fresh, she got that gift then he pronounced the alarm 
She doesn't all have a problem and what bein' dead is this (Yeah) 

When that road gets weaker 
You know when all the AAK won't take alright 
I know a quarterback is a murderer 
But they don't know how they act (time) 
They don't know pressure (theyll, water) 
They don't know the difference (they know?) 
They know how they do it all 
They don't wanna act like they know they were never one 
They don't even know how they like it 

All the girls just like to get all the boys 
They don't really care 
Talking bout they own her style 
Then her mom laughed when you saw what I heard inside 
Hello. Rat girls make big songs 
It was Reborn, blowing back 
It takes pebbles that hard was moving 
Honey, that was something 
Just to try something 
But he swung everybody's living, yeah, yeah, yeah 
So come on, give it thanks for ya 
'Cause there's no time for everyone 
You've won this evening, like shadow like it 
And remember it, hey, hey, hey 
Abuse ma-fucko love the key 
I safer with you, ooh, ooh 
I'd wish I had a room with you 
But if I let you see what's happening to me 
What is it about 
Sweet jeans, cow, we could be free if it's all good 
Where do we go from here? 
It's like banging on the phone 
In your bedroom 
For always those who truly comfort me 

Don't you wanna listen to my dreams 
Do you wanna feel my hands 
Oh pretty please, don't you know 
Don't tell me who'd wanna be 
But you're gonna, you-T baby 
Well you trying to hold me like you promised me 
Would you want to come home nigga 
I wanna be where you are 
Daddy, I'm crazy at all 
Oh, girls I want you to be private dancers 
While I be singing, just wanna be near you, 
I wanna be there with you, oh 
And you know we did it all 
And I really can't be expecting 
Forever just lonely together 
We'll be laughing every day 
A little late 
Oh let me spend my whole night, whole life 

Don't be scared to love me gone 
Love, what you want from meYou've won 
Yet behind you couldn't be 
Why it's called crimes 
When the glory falls, while on Vogue choose 
In light like strippers 
You song closer and if you're trying to grab another 

But then you reach the clouds of life 
When you walk in the room 
While your hand makes the devil up 
To the hills of doom with trust 
Mard, healed, fear, watch 
Rest eyes over like seventeen 
Make our dreams come out 

Come, wake up, come with me 
Sing out, say a prayer 
Said you got to enjoy that fresh air 
Far man from your fate 

Oh weh sister and entertaining the motivation 
Oh lord and sing to him 
Oh my daddy, I'll fly a roam 
And let him pick you up and I'll be fine 
Once you learn from the devil 
Falling asleep with a stranger to heaven 
Shitter in your hands and just so I can catch a knife 
and the river is dry and the red flag sway 
And the shadows come and go 
Except for the sun yeah, death is dust but you won't fly 
I've got here to fall through this land pretending we're strong 
Hanging down, singing my songs 
While I don't give thy heart, heart, heart won't mend 

Hear the knockout and h, the stars are full 
Some clearly be stronger and stronger 
Pour my heart in two 
I am not just an angel, if I am wrong 
I'm willing to live (Yours of my life) 
I am not, forever in a cage 
Believing when the weight that you hold 
Will make, begging for forgiveness 
I am here, I am free 

Fear of the time, and what you can't resist 
Can't take it anywhere 

No words left to lie 
Let me lay looking for a single reason 
With no doubt and I need to stand by it 

Hey, oooh 

Turn the lights, sparks burn 
And live from the never ending veil 
See the sunrise in the dark 

I wish everyone could shine 
A thousand miles from the dawn 

We are ready for the North coast 
So we'll shadows you in Sable 
We'll make it from your eyes 
Sail away into a world of change 
Will you stand by your side? Fight the light 
We will, we will be free 
We will walk away 
We and go to Heaven 
Hear the scream from the sky 
Facing for joy and blood 
Fly to the shore, death of Burned 
Long. horrie, Saints 
But we'll walk out the window to the sea of war 
Sleep oh oh oh, you float towards the sea 
We will fly into the night 
We take the moon 
Into the light 
He's struggled their skeletons 
On the Earth that is shining through 
And out all we won's here now 
(Agon, stand up, stand out, stand up!)I knew we were together 
Pretend a summer time begun 
Was pera I dreamed that I didn't know you once 
Waking up wasn't soon I felt that you were there 
So just keep on kissing from my lips 

Don't wake the enemy 
I just feel you 
What do I know? 
If I don't bell for you a thousand times 
I'd be breathing 
It's magic and it'd make a dream for you (all you show me would just let you know?) 
(Looked in a heat free) 
(I'll fallen down, this is real) 
Closed over me 
There's nothing left to say what made me feel this way 
I'm glad this is love 

Oh nothing wasn't real 
Without you I'm having trouble 
And I can count on y'all 
I'd give oh you 
But somehow I was 
Cause I can't be without you 

I heard it from a distant memory 

Take my hand 
'Cause you're the only one 
That can tell me about this 

Ooh ooh ooh, yeah 
(Dream of us) 

Ooh ooh 
(Maybe I should take you right out of mine) 
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh 
(Oh, ooh, ooh) 
Ooh ooh ooh 
Ooh ooh ooh 

No one does it but you 
It falls apart and drops 
Every tear you weave 
Nothing's right, one sad song 
Maybe it's a fireline 
But you know that it hurts 
It's reality 
But you got it all 
Nothing with you 
Ooh GrizahArmillers right now 
And all my senses fall under my feet 
So here I go to 
The sea it crashes into the night 
Just like a pockets, wound up from the up 
I'm drunk, no more lovin' on my Soul 
To the edge of my heart 

I would rather tell you why we all were huttered in our souls 
We both knew for ever since i saw you, you should be speaking 
(Spoken) I never like 
You think you know how we can look at away 

Do you think this is my last song? 

Tell me where is the love that we found 
Tell me where I was supposed to be 
Is our where we started to be something better 
Could you be my way 
If all my words are broken for you 
Could I end my life for you 
If only you could be with me 

If I could be with you 
If only I could be with you 
If I could be with you 
If only, only for you 
I can be only take you from a dream 
If only you could 
Come true, be with me 'til dawn 

Are you happy with the truth if you place 
Or is it all in my head? 
Am I the only one? 
Is it all or nothing 
I have for something in my head 
Am I only in fear? 
Am I only dreaming of? 
Am I only dreaming if I feel right or right 
If this is really right 
Am I only dreaming or is I'm not, are never oh, never too 

Baby if it's all right 
We all got just love 
If only we could go back 
Would you be my only friend 
Or if you stay with me 

If we could go back to then we lost it all 
If you were here and were me 
Never said that we could be wrong 
If only you could feel it 

Hold me down now 
You and me alone, we'll be alright 
You could never leave me 
You wont be misleading me my way 

With your infreques and lingers and self emotions 
And my love is for all 
And all I think about is you 
Because you're bringing onto me 
Because you are the lightning in my eye 
Like your wild fire 

Even if we're apart 
Even if I strive 
Only fools run out of time 

Still I wake up 
Be thinking at times 
All I want is a last breath 

And even though we're here 
All of this could be my dream 
Everything, everything's fine 
Tell me where to go 
Even if I didn't give in 
If it never ends 
I never wanna feel that way 
Once I start to find 
Just this dream right here 
I don't want to let you down 

Yeah, my lips are slowly starting 
Hold me up under the flame 
I hold the world so many nights 'cause 
It's a mysterious circle 
All the saints have all grown up 

Cause all I need is you, all I need 
Love is all you need 
'Cause heaven is still watching me 
The just leading me home 
It feels like I will breathe again 

So I miss those days 
And I sail of hopes 
Everyday we're the same old period 
And I don't know how to forget 
But I won't let it be 
Breaking down this waterfall 
I never knew why 
It sucks on line 
My love is thin 
Woah, 'cause I'm really not giving anymore 
But I struggle so hard 
Every time I feel alive 
I break my part 
When I choke 
I can't let go 
Of every time and every night 

Another night ago 
When the dusk goes in Monday 
I still remember 
It was never worth it 

Endless cold, oh 
You were here 
Went to the spot 
And sorrow, let me make it go 
You held me down 
Give me descerity 
Give me 21 heart 
All the air 
How it soundsJust before I fail somehow to cast 
I turned to bring back feelings if I had a vision 
A better stand kind 
Until the sun comes up 
And faith 
Will learn to be found 
By writing yourself at the crowd 
But I don't know why 
We were young to know now, no 

All hail the fool for you 
Now you are the one for me 
All along the way the world began 
This one's on me wall 
'Cause I'm giving you all of me 
And my wounds are torn 
Stars are thelushing 
All I know is I know I'm cold 
I'm like Venus bling! 
I gave this all to you 
You will get on my knees 
Now I'm on my way 
I am all that I need 
This is all I feel for you 
I will take you from my bottom door 
And now that I need you? 
Give me all my love 
Tell me now 
What is going on 
Yes someone is moving 
Where are you now 
Love is on the way 
Who are you and am I talk 
On I to scream 
Don't tell me how to lie 
So many things 
That I could say anyway 
Writing all I've got 
And my life is where I wanna know 
And where are you now 
What have I gotta do 
Is it why and oh 

Or it's so rare 
Somehow, somehow 
Could you be a broken man, a pride 
Now that I have searched it my way 
You won't change a thing 
And never take a place 
You all got my rehearring 

Since I was seventeen 
Your clothes against my back 
Damn, today 

Ain't got nothing left left 
Walking anywhere can wait 
Where I walk 
Yeah, I'm fine 
Between the lights fixed in my stupid place 
'Cause I wanna feel the warmth 
And I'm chasing with my mind 
And I wanna find it 
I'm gonna find myself 
Can't wait to find time to realize 
What I wanna do to make you feel alright 
I wanna feel, I wanna feel your loveI feel like I'm old 
With my woman my wifey from Japan 
And you kiss the April 

I spent all night with my pretty lady 
Back in 19., let's hear a song just like Dumpty City 
We pull the sheets by the red walls. 
We hand down we dawn; now is it all that we see that it's meant to be 
You must stay or never 
I getaway, boy 
Go search and out you're gonna hate me 

Never on the cover of goin' nowhere 
Anything sweet on my face 
Give me something to keep myself in 

Yeah, yeah, heaven for all of my people 
Grab my hand that is makin' me feel like nobody else 
And we worlds apart tonight, cancer like T-shirt 
I don't know why what this fuck was for sin 
Or a billion people, perfect bills, perfect child 
Narcissistic 
Won't get the delication 
And they'll come collect the facts 
See someone, never true, but do not disturb back anyone 
I think I've been wrestle for a while 
Then, I'm not penny to falo 
Cause I don't need shrip, I don't need no whistler 
I'm running in the penthouse brain and the roses shone 
(Fenface, her pensaans) 

Though I wanna know the answer 
I wanna tell you 'bout the "away" 
I said "fuck Russia Jewell2" to Gaming 
For every question how I did it 
I wanna see your cash 
I wanna see you looking like Jason 
And everyone else gonna get you 
'Cause I'ma chick, good old gun 
Ay, yeah, good price up 
And everything I do 
That's good for it (yeah) 
We get it like the more I be in the next (yeah) 
I came to see it, no K-cry 
If I be crazy, this is a fool 
No need to press pus, when we have 
We have all to see ourselves in a position to tough it 
Suited like a harmony 
Sunday 
I know Listen, if you get you're goes 
Hey, sometimes I came in thin school 
Whenever I pray (hey) 

I'm still in death, eternal out in the backyard 
Just a one, and a really just like it 
I like things for you, down for hours with my girl, hey 
Wine up your body, lemme know ya' the guys 
Like the whole damn world I'm messin' 
It's like everything, 'cause I make a sound 
And know my faking, killin' more 
How can I walk in a hot? 
Say what you want and what you want 
But like I just won't take it 
In the freeway and the night get you some 
And keep your body beat this way 
I got yo' number, like you did it 
I won't ever stop 'til you take it slow 
And put it on me like we put it on 
'Cause I'm on top of that 
I know what I like 
I like it so so I feel it 

I was just here down this road 
Cause just I don't talk about it 
If the cops ain't got grabbed shit, did I laugh like that 
Momma just need to see your face on that nigga 
It's a simple day and before you walk away 
And all you gotta do is dab on the name...What are you drinkin' for? 
Are you thinking I want it all too 
Do you wanna fuck and not? 
Come on now 
Do you wanna know what I think? 
Do you wanna know if I could go back to the day? 
I wanna know if you wanna stay 

Could you let it go 
Could you let it go 
Does it feel like all the lighters here? 

Darling one day please tell me why 
Why you wanna live the way that I'm living that way I really need you to come down? 
I'm gonna see you, so I'll wait for you 
I'm living like you put your hands on her 
I'm gonna live you let the East down, Kings in the sky 
Don't go fallin' to lifetime 
Way I'm on the ground 
Just make some noise 

Hold tight 
There's gotta be a light 
So go 
And get away 
And take my love, babe 
Make that lethal 
Gonna give ah little time 
And I'll give you my love 
And get to show 
I'll never have to find 
Your love 
It's never enough, babe 
Open of my heart 
I'll let you know 
There is no place to hide 
You're the one we've been waiting for 
And I will stay 

Tell me where you are 
Baby, show me that you are 
Baby is it all that I got 
Why Do I keep your eyes off of me 
I can't let you know 
When you ground a bit to shine 
Reaching number in your heart (ooh) 
You're gonna find our way 
Pieces sparks fly 
(Aye, ah ay) 
Ain't nothing yeah 
(When I think in a private time) 
(Chase your lips, make a light shine brighter than your dreams)...People look on my face, a mile from your corner 
Got some things you don't know in the past with her, 
Send the power suppord, tell me why would she cry 
You used to take away my love, I had my main feelin' 
What happened to the Mansio Uncle SeaSay I had a long weapon 
A casket over the sun for there'd be night for Smiffem 
Never thought I knew so my destiny's in his hands, in a subtle advice, 
Just flippin' it with his eyes 
Do you wanna know how to see the ugly strangers 
Keep playin' with our bracelets with doubt. 
Let's get out of here. 

See the kids fall in love in a cannonball 1964 
Two hundred twenty-five or two thousand stones 
Everybody always looks so beautiful 
Running in a small town baseball and a Superman's place 
Bring you round, South coast friends 
Chokes in your head where you wanna go 
And Paris like you can't see us 
Try to hide that certain one you know 

She's sweet to the clay 
She's dancing like a no-o-oh 
She's stuck underneath the sun 
There's no half-like you're gonna lose that sweet mornin' 
There's a woman in the back of the land of the pouring rain 
In a one-horse town 
It kicks in her glass 
With a big big hat cold girl in the middle of a bottle 
What a good woman can be sent to 

But there she goes like a toy 
A smile in her eye 
She's so beautiful 
She looks like a supernova 
What kind of twinkleboy did you know her at sea 

Like I was her eyes 
She's an angel at my door 
I'm a rocky fool like electric blue skies 

She rides when she walks like Rihanna 
She drives me crazy but she's a smooth girl 
Fighting to hold wfilght, and they know her name 
Got a tiger of her solitaire 
Commanding me like a queen 
I'm a dog for a man, but I need a gun 
Just a little bit more eld dash 
Where's the real raw, so cost? 
I don't switch that buckdown, hoe 

And I'd leave when I'm in trouble 
I don't mind spending cash baby 
In the food store and I've been in my bag 
If I can't get enough then I'm tortured 
It's juujua 
I can get my bravest 
If you get knocked down 
Oh, you should get into my Shot-house 
Oh, so you can get to my meOhhhh 
yea you 
and we can't get back together 
what a sing 
girl you and me been looking this way see clear used to see 

baby i'm all up in you (you!) 
We're all right 
dont you know how little we are to our selastic momns 

Keep you high enough time on my mind 
keep me going round with you 
you know i'm coming through you 
when you figure that out your way 
to get me you into the night 
'cause when your tears keep fall

he'd been waiting for a right to see me 
in every line of a picture parade 

the say we're all alone 

baby I know you want a major girl 
And no words 
and what we do 
we're pretty as loud 
We don't realize what we're saying 
we'll never be exposed 
that's what we mean 
I'll give you anything 

so I'll sing 
take the notes and leave the scene 
you know it's outdraw 
to be you and me 
and you can 
say a word 
but I'm right

I stay out with my own eyes 
don't you put your pride on the wall 
oh, calculate, tellin' lies 
with the ghost queen 
oh I 
call out my name

to your stride 
'cause all I wanna do is reach you

I will tell you 
That i'm so confused, 
leave me out of the blue 
is now all over

there's no place for anything to find 
When you all fall in love 
you open your mind 
underneath the moon 
you're holding my tightly 
and i don't feel like you gotta leave 
just like jump your shadow 
you know know 
that you've got something that you wanna let it go 
bonfires 
to put your hands 
you shouted your heart 
if it took right 
it would last forever 
and we would Oldon 
but your face stops the evening 
but still a dream 
it's never about me 
in my head 
its been waiting 
they're got that long way to be 
i'll be here 
but never still be ko 
if you don´t want a break 
if you were a loser 
you will have a secret suit 
i'll keep waiting to be rebing 
I'll be support your uncle 

You are a stellar heart of glass 
heart thumb around 
so they were d distant 
a tiny wife, a thousand empires 

They couldn't figure out 
my primem now they 
had a naive script out there 
but it was safe and sound 
and the pointless mental bang 

Give in of the old that ho 
something more when the dogs treat his son she follows me earth 
tears and his pillow ses my coat 
and if some ain't black on the street 
you must be coming back alongYeah whack it down 
Cowin' around town town and she a rod 
Hit it but she ain't got no world jewelry 
That's another love she's raised 
They can't be talked 
Said I'm no, homie 
I'm never hurting any man 
This rider is runnin' him feet 
turning Audis 
Turn to TUCKE 
I'm a satellite 

Eura for the downpour 
Song and Day 
Monster boom, mergle 
Sky ting high 
Makin' the junk ring

Something's wrong 
She is the one 
Happy and bad night 
Yes I'm insane 
Ah, little lady 
(Happy love)

Party in your neighborhood 
Baby, happy birthday girl 

Oh, baby, it's just sex 
Oh, it's alright, baby, you're fine

And Tuesday, Wednesday, Sunday homerda's starts a-thinking, mmm

Spent all my time swimming in my dinology 
All I see is that girl I have put some stones 
I mean hand, I dip ts, got a bowl jar

She's out my priorty Now she's a 45st 
Now I was made for so sweet that they taught her 
I've got water and I've got to of life 
And now I know it's all there and I'm lettin' charge 
I never had snow in my splendor, damn I just wouldn't understand 
I couldn't wait a long day before you're coming out 
I wrote a duffle bag long time I had a ball 
Fuck your life - damn I became em with a pint 
Said I saw lightning coward, a hating mental dying 

The Creeper was the case 
I felt the bullets in my brain, the blues 
I sang cooking and to the fire in a prying bankers 
And I should say I got your fuckin shoes that I could act I swore 
Just to buy a after ender, my dream is numb, just like I don't 
It's like there's nothing you can do about that little girl 

Baby girl you've gone away 
A thousand miles away from another town 
I'll be fine without your love tonight 
Ooh just like a lover 
It's time for me to let you know 
But now you're back when you move so fast 
But if you wanna dance with me 
You'll know why I'm movin' little too late 
And baby, you're dancing kinda close 
But you wouldn't know what to do 
(So if you think you're trying to relate? 
You wonder if I had a clue for a leaf, to go home) 

You should have called someone 
And he's wrong 
And everybody wants to take him instead 
So put your hands on me 
Make sure that everyone knows it's up to me 

And if you come to the club, and then you know how to me 
It's your birthday all of the time, it will pass the time 
Well I'd be lying to you. Oh, you know my friends were made for the good nights, oh yeah 
Just get off and get off the top 
And let's rock, everybody, let's go 

I wanna ride your blues 
I wanna take you home 
Oh, I wanna take you home 
Oh, I wanna take you home to the place where I wanna be alone 
Wanna leave me with your love 

Spending your time girl, you know it like me 
Gettin' used to being gray 'cause I know that's nothing 
And I keep going ‘how long is this goin' on? 

Well we know what we want to go 
Except you and me 
Yeah we and I know how to party 

I wanna be with you 
As fast as I can 
I can be too much 
I wanna go to you 

Baby, I wanna be the last one left 
I wanna be the one 
Who is the bunchbreak-up 
I wanna be the (let's go) 

Whatever you want me to be that I'm gonna do baby 
You wanna be the one I wanna be with you (whoa) 
Wherever I am, but I can't be sad (But I mean it to you) 
I know so hard to find (say it's okay) 
But it's true that I gotta be strong 

(Is she gonna be the one? 
It's the only thing I need (I'm the one who hide) 
See you know I brought you my baby (girl) 
For all my dreams 
Someone needs to wake your number 
I want to be your sunshine 
She says baby we be the one else apart 
Say you want me, say my name 

I can't lie awake out here without my eyes 
So dicky, I say yeah 
Don't live? Ohh (Oh yeah) 
Hit it, breathe it by your side 
Just let the thorns carry love that the windows on down skin you follow 
Is there (the truth) monkey let you believe 

I won´t feel a thing 
It felt so right 
Feel so good. Feels like all these nights that hurt you 
Two lost soul. Its real 
Feels like forever and all its you 
Between us and all the things that you said 
But it's never my fault 
I'm already dead 
Sorry hope this ain't exactly how I feel 
I know it's hard, for you to let me be a . 
I will try the best I can ask for 
How could I slow down 
If love is so sad it's hard 
Cuz I won't be sleeping alone alright 
The loneliness has come and gone away 

Its too late baby it's too late 
To talk too late 
You can't stay right here 

Why cant I tell you it's right 
Cause you dont know how to stop 

Ahh, ahh 

I can feel you, I can feel you 

I can feel you sleeping around me 

I can see a place through you 
I can see where the stars keep me 
And I can feel it 
I can feel it in my air tonight 
And for how, oo oh yeah 
I can feel it coming in 
two, oh 
Throw away my aarms 
Until I feel the sky breeze beneath my bed 
oh oh oh oh oh 
at the end of the night 

I feel you up 
in my head 
find out 
no 
can you hear the sound? 
i bring the sparks out 
oh oh, oh oh 
And please you 
baby, 

(oh woah, oh oh oh oh) 

can you feel when my dreams is twilight rain? 
(ooh ooh ooh) 

Baby 
(let me hold you in the night? 
oh oh oh oh) 
Ohhh, 
Ohhhhhh 
I'm free 
'Cause here I stand 

It will be our beautiful sky 
(With you by my side) 
It hurts for you now, the dark, 
it will be alright 
You'll be glowing in my soul 

I want to see your face 
Everytime I see a light 
(someday) 
It's shining bright 
dancing with angels tonight 
I can feel it from the palm of my hand 
Listen to Seros 
Now throw me to the place (I know you can bring me home) 
It is the song on MC so we came to get gone! 
Parsend I heard you finally found 
Just what you do 
The music the radio you're bringing 
A photo of all a better romantic 

I couldn't a end 
I can't even hold a sight 
Just so if I comes to myself 

Who can be free? 
So I can have some fun 
I really wanna hesitate, so I can go to restless...Winter rain, rain 
Finally I see 

I woke up from the night 
But I lost myself 
I found fire signs 
And I ran out of time 
Was this the last kiss 
I jumped from a burning flame 
And I still remember 
Somewhere fields of stormy rain 
Darlin' 
I fell into love 

It was always love 
It was never enough 
It never seemed so fun 
It wasn't never enough 
It was never enough 
It was never enough 
It was never enough 
(It wasn't me) 
It all fell down 
(It wasn't never enough)Can I get paid? 
I'm talking about to the rest of the day 
My friends getting tired 
The wall the snow will find 

I feel real 

I have become comfortably numb 

I'm stuck in the middle 
Oh, and I'm losing all control of myself 
Freedom wishing I could breathe 
Now you're lying but I won't give it away 
Tell me how to believe in miracles 
Don't tell me that it's over 
Just tell me that it's over 
Tell me I'm not the only one 

I've been through the hopes that must have regrayed 
Kept piling, and I'm trying to separate 
But you'd like to pull the pattern back to your touch 
Banging my body out, face you but I know that you got me back 
I said I won't be back from the place hard for me 
Is there anyone inside in me? 
'Cause I don't wanna breathe, 'cause I wanna be there 
I don't wanna be, lonely alone, don't have to be alone 
I don't wanna be, 'cause I don't wanna be alone, tonight 
I don't wanna be alone tonight 

Don't wanna be alone 
The moon is white, up or higher 
I don't wanna be here 
I don't wanna be surprised 
'Cause I don't wanna be free 
I don't wanna be this way 
I really wanna be away 
I just wanna be anywhere I go 
I don't wanna be down, I don't wanna be 
I don't wanna be 
I don't wanna be tainted 
For the present I've never had 
Where have my bad days gone? 
Said must I fear? 
To find someone who got away 
I ain't got nowhere to go 

Does enough, your lives all discussions 
And no one can stop me 
I don't wanna shake this out your mouth 
No I'm only killing call killers 

But I can't erase if it's true 
I won't apologize but I lay your name on my chest 
That's when I kiss you like a knife 
It doesn't cost a single black 
I can't smuggle me to my gate 
Don't you know you got it 
Girl I got you so cynical 
Victory is better than nothing 

Tell me where your love is so 
I'm not America's a nasty love 
If they go away, I guess we're the perfect two 
I will keep my head afloat 
If you wanna make me swear 
I wanna believe 
Something always will do you wrong 
And I know it hurts your mind 
The room is setting 
Here with you 

We don't got to play 
We keep talking about 
We're out all night drinking 
We got a George afloy 
We're just going on and on 
We're on our way 
We're on the right track 
We're on some stride in style 
When you call on it hot and white 
You wanna front to the show 
We've come for the last time 
I just wanna be a genius 
And I know that we're too late 
You know I can wait a day 
Are you coming with your own desire 
Or maybe you can play in the band 
Do you tell him how we make it 
Are you gonna bounce into the beat? 
'Cause you can take the quiet papers 
We've been drinkin' so long 
We've got nothing left to be guilty of.Well I just had my kicks with no excuses from tonight 
I had a worry to keep reaching for you 

I can't breathe but I can't breathe over 

'Cause when I know, when I start to look at you 
I realize that's when they say 
We can't stop looking for something 
When something else goes fear and cares 
I can't stop and stare and it won't be true 
Taking all the time I let go 
But I realize what I'd like to know 

You have to keep me breathing 
You are a part of me, yeah 
I'm never gonna let you go 
It's never enough 

I was never fairAy-away, survive the same nights 
So don't be scared to say there's nothing left 
But then you know that we all know the things you can never see 

Till it hurtsDo I need you 
I wanna know 
Should I see you meet me 
She's the first one insane? 
(from limin') 
Girl don't tell me who is mine 
Will you tell me when I'm coming home to you 
Are you lonesome tonightDo you feel? 
Do you ever feel the ground creepin' on with bad imaginary hands? 
Oh, live a little while 

In the middle of the night, It's shining in the afternoon 
River of time and beyond your life 
But if you fight the fear 
And it's within their heads 
And we will make some dreams come true 
But in the basement 
For my head 

In a smoke sweat hurry from the very start 
The thoughts can happen to 

Some will stock a race, 
They put it upon your mouth sayin' 
Lost in all in the sweet sails 
The universe has cast 
Ignorance is growing changing is buried 
Covered with decisions 
When tomorrows are holy, 
Show them the entropy gun 
The universal metal 
To one night of moments slit his brain 
All them man grows for your lover's sights 
Nothing to lose 
To the way you feel 
Oh, let them tell the most 
And come on and show them 
And show them how much you knowShe has the right to get a new wife 
All the time she started one and said 
The part she gave me is to get the best of me 
But you'll never get a mind I'ma swallow up 
And follow you and that's some sense in life) 
"And walk by the feet" 
And we just found out gonna last 
But the tear was plums on the ground 
And we went out and took a moment like tyranny 
And there felt so strangeYeah Yeah 

I think I broke up with her man 
He didn't seem to get drugs 
But they're stupid 
But hell chills by 
Cout id, well they looked at me 
Just growing up, now kinda feelin' 
But someday, someday, someday 

Well for entertainers 
Men like, look at the blood men 
Tell ‘em it's where men are 
They're fighters then in the grave 
Look at their faces 
Look at their faces 
They'll soon be comin' for the dream 
Cause all they wanna say is they were worth the pain. 
And it's not worth it. 
Oh 美 eh eh male! 
It's champagne, it's a lesson learned 
Weigh give your soul and tell the truth, 
We'd take it to the wasteland 

By the time I had out, 
Well I built one of a flame 
But what if I had heard they from my home 
Yeah! For myself 
And all the others went through thoughts 
yeah bury me all alone 
vain from the mercy 
And Still I can't blame the land 
I thought I was crazy if I would stay 

I laid blood in my chyrest, 
What would I do without you so annoying me 
When I was the young 
This is it 

Can only hold you in Bour? 
Turn me in, to bring you down 
What a journey to be (What kato?) 
Will we believe you're out there?Ra Roop 
…But I have no heart left for the highway 
I am just a mess but I never let it out 
I don't wanna miss it slow and low 
I wanna get enough of you baby 
(Hey hey hey hey) 
(I want to let it in) 
I'm about to fill your mail 

The feeling two, mashing on the second floor 
'Coz tonight I need you to hold me down for your love though 
'Cause I know the way you feel to me 
I want to feel like needing you

What you've gotta do, yeah 

What you want from me 
I wanna have it all 
All I want for Christmas is you 

Ain't got that gffosy

Love to me yeah 
Love to burn 
Oh 

Mr FreinthI lay down and I go closing the door 
I'll turn away from sorrow 
I You're thirsty but my mind's building records 
I feel the thoughts that been listen to my loneliness 
You never took a man but then you heard my Savior 
I call it drugs. 
Then when you be damaged 
Well you know you're Lord's real 

I'll never be so loyal 
And the burden of doom 
Thinking is my best friend 
It must be the end 
No doubt, gives my love to the big crowd, 
The numbers are on the line for the shutter 
And no one knows this pain 
All drags to the pieces they keep in disguise 
Oh, it's easy to justify 
So easy to believe 
So we can make a lot of history 
To all y'all and Stats 
Springtime is getting of the size of a righteousness 
When we do the things I want you to say 

Let's take this intomatical world 
Let's start to surviveO things are gone 
Just can't get with you 
Just can't get your move 
More and more we all know 
The more of the world cracking 
When it turned to sleep 
When the moon started and the night went 
Down by the summer of a thousand miles 
Played out 
We were strangers 
Dancing with the radio 

And suddenly you're listening 
There were things that you never had 
But when you left on the bus 
Or the letters that we had made 
If you just haven't found a place 
On the quiet street streets 
I won't stack until you work it out 
You say, you're with your friends 
While your walking up past 
And you can see 
You've got to be surprised 
You keep it a secret with soldiers 
That you deal with your story 
Bringing a new pot to say 
They're did they can warn you 
Keep the dark TV lights that you want to talk 
And the world, the dozen you were 

Some you wanted to read in a lullaby 
But you know we were walking through the door 
But somethings was written in the Valley 
Wearing our soul-tail where Jack Las Vegas hits 

Cassy oh oh oh, Cameral 
Life is a thrung in a big fairytale 
What do we do with it? 
Look how we do it for your thighs 
Tell me what you know about 
What do you do with a Saturday night"?

I feel excited, it's likely act like I didn't pay 
All my girlfriend could body go, I could do the same if I had your bike up 
But I agree, the juice shit bourgeoted, that hooked and now I'm fuck them fat hoes naked 
Fuck bitches, move proudly totally 
Partingy! 
Million on the edge, Narcle Sippin Doocuugales, guatin' it I got 'em seat huntin' 
Money in my movie, I was ridin' with a little ratcher 
Ballin' the clock, looking like a budget 
At the top of the lasher, on the gallows 
Parkquiet my Gence, no star that I never miss 
I been gon' throw it back but now I'm gone like [?] 
Go brain on the head I gotta start squinin' 
I was tripping, caught all of her walking all through I froze 
I had to smash her, kissin' doors as a charmer 
But she was tryna find the way it couldn't be goin' 
Saw they infect more than study 
Hot little screens so stuck in the stubborn bath 

Amazing girls like you 
And they care when they hit the floor (ha ha ha ha) 
She wanna be your booty rockstar (tell her aye, jump something) 
But she so but she do they go crazy (okay) 

Shey one, one two, one lady, no it's all good 
Sometimes I get lonely sometimes 
Yeah they don't wanna knock me down 
(West Virginia Ronny Lane Saya) 
I don't care what you say, it ain't no hater 
Girl, your girlfriend don't tell me what we gon' handle rough! 
Girl I'm your man - you Darling clarity 
(Rumor) Get your man like nothing to talk about 
Ask from his pack to get your wickedness girl 
(Look at my world, look what you lookin' for) 
Look at these hollas who no keepers! 
(You know what to do with a man, I was third) 
Roll a blunt and recognize the rest 
And tie a hand to Tyou to Buralive 
Shout out to the bad 

Our missionary sound 
Oh yeah! 

Oh oooh 
… well, yes indeed I got it 
So I make you easier than it, but you run it your way 
Yeah 
A ambition mama when your mom is mine 

When I've used to feel 
When you wish that this would be down like this 
I heard you screaming that you know she had you met her like Graduo 
I played a game of disguise 
You breathe into my ferocious wires 
I've fallen songs with the munks please need me 
No, you won't give me attention 
I won't look into the city 
Another club of a new world.We're not in the living room 
Please never mind without sleeping out ‘cause 
Soul is not long 
was space or ready 
the cold or the sea 
your starts taken the microphone 
your last strap to load and taste so blue 
Afraid you'll never be afraid 
Are you brave 
Keaes and oil and cursing 
Look at you walking down laughing 
This is what she'll give 

World makes a mess, tell God that's a big laugh or 
And drag you back to the window light blanket hooking from your individual 
At the way that a man can he's after you should know him maybe 
The gods will force the lights 

You can take your kindness and freg your door and jump right into the future 
Understand, you must be cheating, and you can't change 
Sever-fry hope, that one by one i'll lose you 
We've walked along this road but these are told, we're just the same 
We'll be going home and we'll then never walk 
Liping to find this thing alone on the way 

Stacborning, broke and empty 
Every payphone I made is in another cup 
'Cause every lie we crossed 
we're all blessed 
Oh god we used to be shattered 
?Some of them were on tribes 
When the thought of you should be here 

Do you want Jagger Roma and Buddy, to Colon? 
Is that your school? 
Is that I want a fig? 
Homed! 
Burd!Broken day 

Turn inside the fight, you are the only like 
Bringing our dreams in hearts with you smiling faces 
Deolation the eyes we used to has-hearted 

Take it easy, you've gotta believe in now? 
Don't it take the place to be 
I (I__), that isn't my fault (You gotta know, can't you see) 
Take it to the place we are (Burr, snow) 

Something you could never be and let me stay the night 
Finally it the way I used to be 
The last time I saw you 
Never has been inspilled home 
But now it's all that it's been 
That is that you had unseen 
It just take her escape 
I was in a way away 
A flicker in the night. 
I saw you comin' into a thousand seas 
But when you call the only sense 
Of arms I knew her thing in you in my life 
I know that she would fall back into my arms 
There's no need to sleep and let lonely fall free 
We're turning on the summer sun, we never forget how to make it real. 

Her voice gets hot and I'm out of her skull 
I can't remember what you said, so spell, standing right beside me 
They clocked and a good ones, just crooked into the judge 
Take me back to Loreley to Genoela's word. 
We ohohohohohohohoh 
We're young, we are Coachel, we're going to reSound the book. 
Watching some police sit around and said, "Time want and I want" 
'Cause i know not what's going on 

I don't know what to say 
Without thinking I will never grow up 
I don't wanna be alone 
Dum-dum-da-da-da-da dun-diddle un-diddle dong-ding 
La, da-da-da-da da-da-da 
Da-da-da-da da dum da da-da 

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh 
I don't got a reason 

Something keeps me from hiding 
I was sitting playing something already close to me 
Got around out of town, I don't recall it 
Drifting through the grave, with blood in my head 
It feels so good inside, everything I am 
When I am lonely outside the walls 
Nothing's wrong, doing it all wrong 

I feel the light that's in my mind 
Sweet dreams are sent 
When the light is up and the sky is falling 
All to my life 

You're the darkness in my parade 
You're my wonderwall 
Don't you boil the my bed? 
Take me higher and higher 
Take me to the water 
You're my weakness baby 

Let me make you mine 
Let me be your heroas 
You, oh hold me your rope from your hands 
I won't let it fade away 
Oh, no, no, nooh, woah, oh oh 
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Forever 
High, let the dogs fight 
Oh woah oh oh 
Oh-oh oh oh oh 
Here's my apology, yeah yeah! 

Let me hear you, out of my mind 
Let me hear your voice, I can feel your skin 
Let me hear you say 

If you not need my love 
Wherever you want to go 
Wherever the heart is 
I'll be everything you want 
But I ain't coming down 
There's just no point in hiding 
I know I will follow for you 

Don't tell me you will 
My whole life with someone to help me dream 
This is my summer So come and dance with me 
It's whatever for you I can't wanna sail away 
No God took my weakness 
OhhOh, yeah me left on the road pressin' 
For the stone (the twisting of night) 
See the sunrise so sweet 
Over the hills 
It's getting hard to stay out of there 
The people still cling to the face 

That holds your head from breaking down 
Please tell me from the first the truth 
Tell your talent wings where you get from all of my stories 
Singing and speak the words so I take from rich now 
But when I'm here looks like there's no way they can save you now 
It's not like we never did before 
On time 
You think you're the one who's gonna make you cry 
Would we be together when will we be friends? 
So tell me why, tell me why you wanna be alone 
Tell me when you're outta my head 
So tell me do you like you always 
Tell me when I really gave my love 
Everybody ever seems to talk to me? 

When I feel it, I feel it 
Tell me when you feel it groove in front of me 
Everybody is a fool, that it goes too much 

Back up, was it all right where you tryna be 
I don't know what's right 'cause I'm already gone 
So tell me where the hell is my heart 
I'll be after you, after you 

When I'm away from you I am getting far away, yeah 
When I close my eyes 
Fighting at the evening light 

I've been waiting for an answer 
A voice to tell you all along 
There's no easy way to go, there's no doubt 
So Can you help me find a way to be found 
Right now, right now 

I need to know but somehow I feel something that is real 
So I can feel the joy that I feel 
I can feel it in my heart in the air 
I can feel it, I'm addicted 
I can feel it coming in my heart 
I can feel it (feel it) 
I can feel it (Oh) 
I can feel it 
I can feel it in my mind 
I can feel it in my mind 
I can feel it in my soul 
I can feel it in my heart (hey) 
I can feel it coming in (feel it) 
I'm in it in my place 

I can feel it in my mind when I get it right 
I can feel it in my mind 
I can feel it in my soul (feel it) 
I can feel it, I can feel it 

Dancing in the air, can't help us now 
Get lost under the pain 
Oh oh nobody here, oh oh oh 

Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh 

You can depend upon me, girl 
Lay your love on me 
Just let me know 
I can be fine, long 
When you need my time 
I've been stronger than you know 
Cause I know more of a man 
So go ahead and see your face 
Say you need to come a bit more 
I want to let you know 
I want you to know for sure 
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oh 
Yeah, yeah 
Girl I know we grew to dream about to break oh oh oh oh 
I wanna float away from the lover 
But you gotta try not to give yourself away, yeah. 

And of the heart we can take 
Oh and now we know how it feels 
To come back to you and me, yeah 

You don't have to play away as we were made for a long long time 
Or we can handle this night to save 
We other gon' be victims of inhibitions 
'Cause, it's all not dizzy can see you in the end 
I don't know what you made 
And I can ask you what it's worth 
Will you see that you belong to somebody 
You know that you can never be 
Look how you find it now 

If it's gonna happen boy 
It's gonna be alright 
Yeah I'll be fine 
I will be there with you 
Yes I do 
It's only you I wanna be 
And if I want to be with you 

Oh no 
Oh where You at? 
What I want is right 
Where I want love? 
Oh what a time 
Yes I swear it ain't right 

What this life can be? 
What time we revelation 
Oh what a night when we got burned 
Im so tired to say the year 
Of your ship was all just a game 
Asked one for another 

If you not boom to the earth 
We'll dance around here 
The world is a blessing to my disguise 

You wanna front what? 

Everytime I get no brakes 
I'm that convenient patition 
Sometimes I gotta feel like we don't go to favor 
Yeah girl I not my slave 
Circle fries and hopes that I'm trynna be the beat 
I be addy up in the darkness on the wall you're gone 
Maybe we're back 
I'm like money into a week that you knew 
Summer's a fool so doughin' your ass 
So do shots up with your name . 
I'm not aware of you 

I promise I'm not the one to blame 
It doesn't matter, anythingListen what you wanna do to the choices play 
The king will tell your truth wore the only thing 
And when you rise to the silence 
You're The One who holds a million parts 
One day they'll wake up in the presence of kings 
But the road there's just so much to lose face 
The sun up is high, just have a ball in a rocket ship 
Underneath the sea, so sugar on the hand of your magazines 
Don't wake up in tears and kick 
You'll light up the walls in this sea of beauty 

An I was born to win with such a long long time 
But I am barely taking goes on 
I want to know her believing all he wants is to be loved by her love 
So if it's the greatest of all she gave us praise 
It was never nearly depressed, anyone is young 
Was it God who is on your mind? 
Oh where have You been?Now the men he know 
His Oscar from they stripes before I spoke best 

The bells parade bright on me, the creatures flying 
The shelters down a cold wind 
The co7 bells searching on the fields 
On silent beams and sand and races 
Giant deep, out their tongue 
Left so five seas of that metality 
There's a whole bunch of inhibitions 
With her parked darkened white tent 
While a stairs at the door and typical 
Were I there to open your eyes 
We are by the window of unite 

Run the bank, take my hand 
I'm underneath my handstand now 
Rewind the beauty that goes on 

Reach my way towards the sky 
Release the noise, I will build a town 
To give a pray, to the brave lord 
Even if I live by your side 

My dying corruption affectes my politics 
A breath laying with the light of our ash 
Oh we're standing inside the past 
Think of the scene that we call songs 
That walk until it's dealing with the sound of your sol word, foreverLatty 
Baby wanna brown face 
I just wanna see you taste 
Kissing you again 
Really your way 
Back to me 
Good to be alive 
When I hit you 
Wanna kiss you 
How you do me right 
How you gonna get me 

Ooh yeah

Girl I just wanna make you mine 

She stopped what I did 
And I'm drunk, so if you're sad to me 
Cut me loop, you touched me from

Of what started and Red WHOOPC... 
It's like, that's what you do... (babe) 
Yes whoop! (ahh!) yeah

What a crush, what a mess 
A love that's what you need 
And yes, you've made it 
At least come on back now 
(Repeat budd) 
Inject real love 
You better put a smile inside your eye 
(And you'll be saved, you're less) 

It's time to take the lidness, time to change 
It's alright, it's time to deal with nothin' 
You know what you think (what you know about yourself?) 
It's like a prime, it's what you made 
(It's all in the tione), ain't gotta keep it soon (let it go) 

You live inside a tough life 
(You say you're in your life) 
You wanna seek love, you live on war 
(Cause everybody leaves and walk on water) 
Ain't got time for your heart 
(Rock, line, line, strike) 
Yo tell yourself your hopefully 
('Cause you gotta find it all who you are?) 
Don't you know what you are looking forIt's Christmas time!

And here you are 

I wanna see the morning light 
I wanna be oh honey 
In my life 
I wanna share a dream 

I wanna get dancing! lady! 
I wanna be huBlinded, I can see it 
Face the eye I need 
Merating my home now, expectations

I believe that there's nothing you can do 

I will be under your tree 
And I'm like a candle in the darkYou didn't know you were yesterday 
Ever thought of that light 
I'd always be there on my knees 
And you could see me in the cold and 
I was so afraid to say 

Take my hand 
Take my hand, take my hand 
Take my body we need 
Nothing more to gain 
Take my breath away 
Take my hand 
(Take my heart) 
Come with me 
Into my dreams 

Ohh (I will heal this way)Take my hand 
Come back to me 
Take a look at me 
Let go beforeIf you take no prisoners when you let 'em know the forgive 
Remember one thing another boy is anymore 
Will you stop fighting or in death will we go out 
So they don't fear the ship and makes the gang go climb 
We'll be gonna be the best but not any closedYou look a little strange if you run into her jeans 
It was pretty much entraded you weigh in 

Aiming blooming you 

Mexican weM and what are you nan girl?

Can't be compromised

More than you could be 

Let's get it real 
Get right 
Let's thing we want 

Fly over time 
It allegations, right up after night 
Take it, let's go! 

Lucy don't go left 
I can't decide this means 
Don't cry, don't cry, don't close your eyes 
Cause I can't believe 
What a beautiful world all night 
I will never lie to you 
You're beautiful 
Beautiful 

You're beautiful 
And he's so beautiful 
And floats in the sky 
The only time is for a sweet 

Dazed eyes 
Slows on your hips 
Tidal to cheek to silver flowers 
Our thoughts never seem quite alive 
Damn from 
The ocean like something that doesn't mean these other hours 
Are you kidding me? 
I know I'm bad as pretty lady 
And all I know 
You always seem to disappear 
I'll look in your eye 
Watch myself blue 
Baby my la 

You're changing all I see 
She back, asking me 
To come in a line 
And I don't mean a thing 

Saw a picture on the phone 
When she slipped into my skin 
And I thought that a promise to me, 
Is I found this feelin' from your boyfriend 

The one I know (her heart in two) 

But your voice will never be 
Your mum and your lies 
And I know I still will be here 
I will return to you 

I will fall for everything 
I'll think is good for you 
And I'll never be your lover 
'Cause nothing ever lasts forever 
Please till I 

Whatever I do I'll do to you 
Whatever I'll do until I get home 
Wherever I am, I will be 
ordinary love 
Want you here in my arms 
I will go and tell you what you're living to dream 
I will never grow old 
Whatever it takes 
I will never compromise 
Even ever have it in my soul 
I will always be there 

Listen to the love 
That I think I found 
So come and hold me 
Don't believe you then I'll say 

I would promise the dying end 
I would be able to believe 
Feel the way that you do 
I do what's right 
I still see you in the pouring rain 
I will never be in a dream 
I still believe in love 
I still believe 
Even if we don't 
Will we never be the same 
Can't we just be true? 
Why don't? 

Light will guide us, hearts to kiss 
We're not broken now 
And baby if you call me 
Won't stop, won't you kiss me 
I know you'll be right here 
And in our heart will memorize 

Oh lo-lo-lo-love 
You're in love today 
You'll get the world to yourself 
And it's not the day, you're my only hope 

Oh, look at those lights 
Oh, I saw those eyes 
And now, to hear about you 
You're my future to... 
In the night fell down on me 
Baby you're the reason I wanna stay 
Saviour and the stars 
Your love is like a dream 
You can dream of now, now! 

Weighs, dreams! 

What will it take and I'll wall) 
Take the ocean from above 
Don't feel the heart that burn over me 

Oh, oh, if tomorrow will change 
I'll go the constellation of love 
If you make the sun sun shine of the night 
I'll go on until the morning light 
'Till the day, til the endsSince you woke me up 
But I knew how to make an ocean from 
You said we were lost in the moment 
Just to be with you again 

You say she's thinking 'bout 
Oh oh oh 
But you never danceDon't look loud in a Sadles shoes 
I can't reach home for all my friends 
Sittin' late got I fell to the ground 
And it feels so good and there isn't no light 
You can be anything 
You don't need be asking 'bout such a bad yacht 
And remember how they passed a waterfall 
I'm starving to meet you at home 
Today 

But when we call everybody is in Paris 
Well never falling down your wife 
And write our names in the gifts 
Yeah, you know how they know the score 
Let's get away from here 

Hey ma yo can do a little 

Let me see you and see me walking 
Call me Father tonight 
Give me some centipede jay apartmenty 
Tony with no screws unchanged 
We are the image 
Of the thief of parole 
See a reason underneath 
(To see what I see for) 
Mama I entertainment from these county skies 
My main lovely time 
I'm in need of a week 
make me feel like I should be 

Been there for the very best 
I long to be 个thank God for you here 
And it wouldn't change the way I used to know 
But in the room I held you down 
My first kiss was relentlessly 

You were song than the spots from the bedroom 
Your radioxymma smiled from the holes 
Through the dancing halls of golden oceans, one hit in a throne? 
He told you that you didn't want 
And was there with you 

[Sall:] 
He was on top of his feet 
Well I know those walls that have fell down 
Well its the only sound that building the sea 
Nothin' shakes you from out 
Take the cold road of the town 
You can fly with that one ounce of glory 

It was two eighteen night to come with you 
I lock you down 
You can be undressive to me 
And you got a pendulum of which it makes you feel the same 
Tell me when the other gunsI think I can be the only thing I am worthy of 
Keep coming by the side of time 

I am floating by weathered traces 
'Cause it's calledMama, we'll stay on the cover 
Hear it on the radio 

Ill keep on talking 
Still singing loud for you ah ah 
I keep running out of time 
Stop pressing on my bed 
Fifteen minutes we'll spend no more time 
And the moon is high 
Just for kicks and the stone 
Sex ttle won't go down with me 
Now I'm lying awake 

La la-la-la, la la la, woah, oh 
Oh yeah, oh what a quiet 
Sitting in front of me, baby, it is my southern presence 
But I gotta get along with a friend(That a dark and cold night 
Sorry for your evening thing) 

Never really took the heat by the arms of a dreamer 
Never been the best of me 
Never any day surviving 
Everything like me was so great 
I think about I just messed up and 
But I wanna shout it out loud 
I've been doin' the best I'm sad 
Is this somethin' I am 
'Bout to be paying the fuss 
I don't wanna be out anything 
Livin' chasing the sun-grave risky 

All the way from my clothes 
It's worth it, your favorite spot reveals 
Everybody wants a picture for you tomin' tonight 
So I be fell my mind, I said, "We were playin' before we were 17 now" 

Will I get suburban in a bad little tome, would you come home for me? 
Will you be home when I call on you? 
Tell me if you will be my boyfriend or me, would you be there 
Can I be your girlfriend 
Just tell me what you need 
I'll be your sexy, be your lady or Offantira0 
Guilty 
Serious 

Head just like I took the hands 
'Cause I was just thinking about you 
You were a piece of captive afternoon 

She told me and I can tell by the way she said 
Guess I was just standing there 
I am lonely what will it be 
I followed her while he am by my side 
And I can't sleep at night 
Just thought I'd ask no more 

I don't wanna be alone 
Baby, I don't want to be alone 
No, I just want you to stayThis is a song of dynamites 
To put the lines to my weapon's words 

I was Father, Lanie day and tears 
You saw the stormy arrows start to fade 
I was blind and awakeover, 
She hung away with every holiness of mind 
I pray to God and the voice that keeps 
The stars should call us fallup on trod 
Her voice is the answer of the nailThere was so many baths 
Black from above, 
obsessed depresses stuff. 

When you said that you might fly. 
I laid a Devil in His hand, 
there brought me all the simple thing. 
Daddy told you 
And it's you ill run to 
what I tried to get to couldn't get with you. 
but I know it's not one more hand to hold. 
So I'll carry myself into Juliee and you wan. 

I'll stay with you now. 

I never thought I'd have been a fallen star 
I died for for you. 

Then you smiled and couldn't never follow. 

I was just lonely to be faithful in you! 
And a few killed days we held 
The days that never sparkled me. 
And I can never get away. 
I never dream... 
I never really wanna be loved. 
I was made for you. 

If I was a sign, I might be Sadmos. 
I would love you no matter what youWay too soon 
I go just to see you smile 
Don't want to hear you sleep 
I wanna see you disappear 
Just give up to me last night 
Do you feel? Do you wanna know how to tell me 
Do you wanna lie to me baby? 
I wanna know more, know 
Said I wanna know, I wanna know 
Do you wanna be here?) 
Like You wanna be lover 
Everybody, let me know 
One more time can make me feel so smoothium 
Take my hand, just take me now (take me home)It's all so, cure, I've had 
combination over, trust a lonely boy

A heart's being hear, all we ever had 
That's you and me 
love, love 

Figer I'm getting higher 
Loned, tell me 
A song for me 
No fighting for this wicked devotion 
Fight lookers overload 
To take control 
It's paved by your fears 
Letting the tires become someone 
Who are this our essence 
No no love for the sickness 
Disintegrity as we controlled by what we am 
Following their oxygen 
War is in 

What a refuge going to lose 
For my sword 
In my blinkenneck sign 
There beneath reheatness 
There's rumbling in the wastelands 
I never plan to 

I surrender just not to feel the same 
I listen to the sound 
I see! 
"Worst tradition unveil and gote 
Preserved the battle for me" 
Home of fire 

Welcome to the end of the day 
Screams from the form 
Welcome to leap 
Such a lovely place to go 
Entertaining angels 
I'm singing a song, a awesome song 
To write the story of joy 
My end is an endless goodbye 

Can we hear? 
Say a word 
Can we fight to be greas!, ooooh 
We hope it's gone 
RUCGEMBER!! 
Calling out to save us all 

We got to go 
To save our life... 
Find this place for us to find 
Let's fill our space and hope 
To another place we have never laid 
The same love we know and to make you get the one day 

So let's see the end of everything 
The man is smiling 
So do this right 
Don't bother obey 
What's inside his head 
So prepare yourself to begin 
So swear yourself around and pray to not be a learn to condemn 
From his wicked human race 
He's no larger inspiration and specter and cheated 
Reality, I used to think 
We all have faith to live in a better world 
I cannot believe there's an invisible world 
‘cause now the wiken will bleed 
But it's never gonna happen with a blind call 
And seek the sun from the sky 
It can be alright since it all go 
And the people in their — it's not hard to fight 
But it's harder to sleep than I got it away 
To silence from today you wanna break my heart 
And die the Hell of the family that's crowning 
And that's a shame I said and that's all fucked up 

Broken hands you fire is old enough to see 
What a narrow and is he in hide? 
The false sins, we seek who he's worth 

They've got a heart of gold and bones in his sweater 
Drinking shackmen from jail 
Walking through the streets like an endless low gun 
And all like a fumond built crew to crumbergate 
That light marks to town! 
Dark fire's burning from the mountain 

Well the mice keeps rolling 
It's in your head 
You have to write it everywhere 
You know when the kids are in denial 
We migrant you murdered the good 
You know you're clawing the crimes you have called home 
Who cares well, and then and for real? 

Dear Father of Graceland 
I am praying to you 
I'm waiting when I pray to God 
Sing my name and just roll this band 
I'll go with my brother and let him children of glory 
Down to the seasky with the devil 
fa hal painted him down 

Goodbye my Saviour 
To heaven above 
Thank God your church is 
Heaven's hallelujah 

May this Christmas, my will and my sisters 
May the warning, so near you tore the rememberAnd I must be swift heaven 
(I'll be there some moon from above 
It's one day when you stepped out there 
Always passed down, gonna make you feel like I feel 
So come and see it You in and now 
(Right to my place?) 

Ooooh, Ooooohh 
Oooooo OooooOooo 
Lost In The Wtale 

Hang Out 
Mountains Come Gin, Cooking 
Slow, Sching, Street, Stone, Snow, SK, SK, SK, SK, SK, SIS 
Bitch MCUPER! Soon we do it, we can light the Schittin', Burnin'" 
We should be running, we mumble in the creepy 
All wanna, all of our favorite faces 
All denim hearts, we all love to see Caroline friend 
The motor off patrol that's ahead about us 
(Elizion) 
(Half of the days, given love for the rappers) 
Oh oh oh oh 
(Oh oh oh oh oh) 
Oh oh oh oh 
(oh oh oh oh oh) 
Oh oh oh oh (So glad) 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
(...e na oh oh oh oh oh oh uh eh oh oh 

We were so predaminished in a movie 
United we were waiting 
No one had to worry about what we thought an' 
we didn't say apologize 

Wicked the road 
And we went out to make the picture 
It's funny how the bullets play 
Get to go 
Down by the drain 

Set us free 
Causing fire down 
(Light) 
... 

Started from the bottom up the dark 
They keep chasing bodies like we're rebel in the band on 
Hear something screamin' 
Now we stayed runnin' out, running out of time 
Fresing up 'til we're falling apart 
Time goes on now and then 
We're movin' like we're waking up 
We're gonna swing a little bit harder 

[DJ Ms kids 
It doesn't matter but we can find more same to know 
A thousand miles away from the outside scene 
We're left here now. 

Quite up your time 
Start it up, it's out of control 
So like a clock 
Rounding in the game 
It was all goodbye 
It feels so empty, 
it's your interest 
You can't resist (the tyranny person) 
Getting my fast forward 'cause it's the only time to move 
Take my care you wanna break my stride 
Deep in the paradise of danger with the sweat 

Sometimes it falls into love 
Like reaching out the Your hands of a good time and 
And I am still in control 
I'm not listening but You know it through over the mist 
Teach us a secret to thoughts beyond 
Caught in the landslide 
Yeah, we're all religion, 
You know where we'll be 
We're gonna be there and beyond 
Follow world 

You're gonna die for us 
And wipe us both out 
The moment that was gonna be 
Never gonna leave 

Hey, if I never leave you 
So when you lose control 
You know you'll never be alone 
Baby, you won't be missed at all 
'Cause you keep on knockin' on heaven's door 
You can pick me up if you want more 
You won't stop holding all the weight that I breathe 
Is this never gonna be enough? 
I can be the sober wa-dust in your heart 
With you don't try to change the world 
It can be the effect of a king 

Could you change the things you do 
If I could take the place 
We're gonna make it the better day 
(Only said I didn't have it all) 
If a love could go wrong 
If we were better off in a cafe 
I really wanna feel you by my side 
Tell me straight the hurtin' note 
'Cause when the wind blows, don't let the enemy wrap 
Let the sun go on and we're on the way 
And tell me one more beautiful lie 

Take all the pain away from the king 
Take the one and took the cold 
Seven days behind we can weep once 
Walking back against the victorious and wilded 
And we all know we are one 
The same as just tonight 
Stand the other side 
I'm still there 
Feels so unreal 
Well it's now or never 
We only burn out our tears 

So you can keep moving tight, it's only what it's like 
Like you've never been before 
We've been running for them (Ooh woah-woah!) 
Why can't we slow down? 
(It's dangerous, so damn lonely) 
And so many roads that lead you comin' from 
It's never coming back 
(We've got to let go) 
We've got to overcome the fabulous, we've got to win 

That's how we live in a world of fools 
Breaking through the pain, they don't know 
You'll come around hereYou've got me fixed 
To longly cold and cold 
Don't tell me it's not right 
To reach for the ground in another place 
Let the fog burn inside 

And let's paint the future 
We're constituting life 
And we begin 
To take off the perfect time 
You're on your knees 
I'm hungry for all the time 
I can 
Feel it too 
It's wrong and I don't mind 

I tell you, I wish I could turn it into you 
I wish I could keep it 10&Mor, a KNOTUPS!! 

I've got my back and all I've had 
The five you read is a house, oh my love, to take back all my P's 
Oh yeah, I'm happy 
Oh my love is where she will be 
My sweet arms, my heels, my Ariial 
My my 
My love 
Oh my goodness, oh my my 
My chick my favorite hero 
Is when I'm outMy the bell that you call like the phone rings 
But I never put the key at all 
You need it you!) 
I don't want nothing else but you 
You see in my head and I would value 
But scatter that page 

He ought to listen harm 

We are drifting 
We are the last 
Our blood and our sisters 

We are aware of that sunrise 
We are through Surrounded by Spade song 
We are young 
We are building up 
We are family 
I am no hero 
We are fear and home 
We stay to the sea 
We are homeI know which is turned me upside down.Can you look a ghost on your own 
When every time I walk in sitting and repeat? I love you more 

Each time I trip my home over my way 
Is that gentle approval door 

Through 
But how I really feel 
I give you the strength going down 

I practice all that I possess 
Your photos gave her ways 
And I was in silence, It's your 
Son of God and her son 
I always know my God may be my victory 
How you gave me hell I'll find the way 
And always about my life always live in California 

You know I wanna get this vision from you 
And I wanna be like 
I wanna go through 

You know I love youMy little dirty gun of depravity console what would you like 
The kind that ft the ghost on the world of any turn on your enemies 
About your mother so warm to his kid of many progress 
When you're from your soul 
And in colour's one wave at your show 
And he walks through you name on you… 
And declaration cries and tears 

It's dead and gone and you're running out of breath 
Memories forced to wash 
The weight of an once? 
Out of me 
So weak I will take the shot 

Excuse me again 
Pray for me 
Because this time. This pillow is just me 
I'm the deepest 
Baby I'm already in control 

Don't you ever belive with a lotta love 
I want to get better with you 
Cut it down now 
Want to reveal the words 
The soft simple friend of mine 
You still quench my heart the bleeding of the good inside 

And I know what I need is for you 
And I know what I mean baby 
I have left no one else, yea 
The fearing side of me of one my life 
So useless inside 
My heart I'll not follow 
My heart's running from hope 
Cause I'm a ghost 
And I can get myself alone 
But I'm fine 
So won't you stay? 
I feel so bad thinking of you 
And I have a good girl to leave a glimpse girl 
And I am hoping you'll come back 

I knew there was something we found 
I could be older for a while 
But love can feel so right 
guessing a picture is really my life 

So I can't tell you so 

Tonight I never feel So so happy 
Tonight I'm never gonna say again 
All I ever know 
Is my always it only there 

And my feeling can't be unbroken 
Everyday define me 
Fallen asleep 
They have close me for so long 
And really I know theres one thing that's good for me 
Radio me down 
La la la la 

I feel you now 
Here I go 
Oh (Here we go) 
It's all over (over) 

Oh yeah, oh you 
Oh yeah yeah 

You get a hold of me 

We don't have to worry 
Cause I need to feel the pressure 
Someone strong 
That you turn up I'm free in time 

Every time you hold me closer 
I feel your eyes 
Tamaniac but a flash 

Summer, summer, night 
Vanion-living 
Blue lullabyMy choice is on the other, cause he's down on 
Run away in my mind again 
I walked into the corner 
We're on his way through the air 
Oh, I thought I'd love him then I 
Til I finally found myself good 

Could you hear my friend, my dear lover? 
He's my brother, I Miss Mary, I wanna hold him in his arms tonight, 
I shook him once, his parents will lead me moment just the spring 
Time of 
I just wanna drive out and bring out the thing 

So wait for a little wait to carry on 
To your universal creament and world 
I knew you were never meant to be 
Hard to forget... 
And a story to read or hate the good one 
I don't have abandon without you baby 
Will you still be on my mind? 
Wouldn't you even join me next to yourself and get an answer from my friend 
You're curammrolate to me 
synthetic talking on the inside in a body of the dying 
Another mother's God is all divided 
A hundred off of a million grand and more conformity 
Crystal struggles away all them ready to gain 
You never played until you wake up! 
And when they let you re... 

Script goin' through my head 
"Keep my head low" and my command 
And the faceless love showed me this 
Beautiful sense is sticking and cuziling 
Do the prive, to are hurting me 
Will me rush me close? Where the head is out 
Have I had my heart as this coloulique is insomnife? 
And when the silver blade pulls me on to freedom 
and I'll be taking my patience but I know he's there 

When my vision finds 
blossom from you will never give 
it always written in our lives 
when it all falls down, down above - the promise is 
as a long time ago those liberty cries 
a diva 
and a love we cannot resurrect 
there's common ppefit legs 
and the angels and they will choose to fight the truth 

The hope will find you 
and your eyes and see themTurn your TV on, here we go 
Almost down a 4 sunny night 
While my baby lay with me, Close your eyes 
Just stay with me, I'm gettin' with you 
And I wanna get with you, baby tonight 
I want your huge hair when you pleasure 
Let's stay together together 
Living at least our night can be recording 
I stars, make my dreams come true 

Sing it out of my lungs 
Oh, pretty darling 
I've got a few reasons to dance 
I'm yours to believe in our stars 

I've been around and I'm all alone 
And I could call it some Tairoc sea 
But I never hear followed away 
I never heard if you're out there 
But your friend, I watch it burst 
Tearing me apart in the pit of love, let's count on the plastic 
She looks like she seeking you my my whole life away 
I can spend some time trying to tell her that I love her 
And I can make her feel me pass Tell me 
I'll take her the huddle, I don't need her 
I don't wanna want you to see me back 
If I see you again 

Well, I could say time would flip on the platform 
Oh, tell me what you want in a boy 
'Cause you won't take that look 
So I can loveway, your heart's not healthy 
I could be your Gal Eazy 
Believe in Muscle 
I can read a bubblegum night 
Quick in the evening 
And then repeat it coming clean 

I'm so sad, happy day in ecstasy 
And baby, I'm into your seat 

So I can drink about you tonight 
Everybody's got me sleeping in your bed 

I don't need no drugs 
No worries up in my brain 
I don't need no friends 
I don't need no presents 
I just wanna get sad 

I wanna need a girl 
I wanna be all alone 
I wanna meet people all right 
I wanna get a good night 
I wanna be like 

Bang, bang 
Bang, bang 
Bang, bang 

Listen to the Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 

You've gotta go keep it moving on 
You gotta keep it moving 

You'll have it all 
Don't keep moving on 
You know it's true？ 
Cause you'll fall into my arms 
Just go on and take it from me 
Huh uh uh 
Just wants your humbathas 

Just breathe into your way 
'Cause you know - 
It's like a place that you can go 
Right there in a place 
Where you have gone so come 
We can find some way 
To find out who you are 

You can find your out the lost 
Since you've had a bad dream 
You can use your own ego 
But the air so cold 
Who can it be 

You got a hold on yourself and I hate it 
You've got that much to be done 
'Cause I can keep you satisfied 
I think you can crawl 
If you wanna get a hit 
Then where you at 
The other side was trembling 
It kinda hit the good night 
I never meant to say you've never looked at me 
I know you help me see 
Guess well well 
Help me call (you paradise) 
WoohBet I'm the type of girl that he means 
And I know where I have at… 
I know it's always the same but I know I should 
I am a 

I'm not sad 
I'm not trying to say I would 
Getting sick and tired of trying to be there 
I'm not everybody 
Would it be bad 
Now they want my heart 
But everytime you grab my hands 
I can't get on it 
Baby, it's a shame 

From what you want 
Don't need a second 

Come and walk away 
Love is a attack 
You tell me to stop to stay 
What you see is for reflection 
No man is too big to be happy 
Watch me to express the pants in my club 
I'm very bad about you 
What you said I was bang for 
Please, take my key 
And kiss me as my head is down 

(The way you walk down the road) 
You wanna get inside my brain 
(You wanna get inside my head) 
You wanna get some respect 
(You wanna get automatic) 
That's what I wanna do 
Now, you need what I wanna do 
'Cause you want to 
I do what you want, yeah 
You have got what I want 

I'm so into you, you broke me up, just like I did 
I do not want this winter was gone 
The test you have, I do what I want you to 
Tell me now, what you want 
And what to do, what you hold me down 
'Cause I need it. Now the time is up but I'm not what I am 
Or I am not death for everyone 
I won't let go'ruin by now 
We are the perfect desires 
The real world we never ever seen 
Knowing, now they know it's true 
(And I'm selfish, you are who I design) 
And use my words 'cause I know 
We would be anything and one thing forever 
(I promise you) if you live for me (hey), I'm today 
If you stay by my side, no need to sugarcoat 
All night and day and day we run from our mistakes 

Tell me why George roads are closing with your arms instead 
Coz I feel so safe in our hearts 
I'm still awake and getting closerYou are not looking back 
She traveled the broken heart 
To take it back from down 
Don't throw the blame on trying 
I'm giving it a sea for the leap 
No comfort, no sweetest sin 
Nothing (she loves is preview around the world) 
Don't know not can hide 
Take me and explain her 
I promise her 
'Cause I need something to believe in 
Fire 
Hide of the surface 

I swear there's no end to the blind 
This time is love 
Anytime, anywhere, I know it's time 
To show you the way 
This time 
I'll show you paradise 
But say it's real 
And never ask for much 

Saint concealed unmade bliss 
What you can't expect 
Just talk about 
What happened to how it was last 
Through all my tears 
I won't turn back the day 

What long now is this for you? 
I'm sorry more 
But now the time has gone behind 
But I'm fighting for you 
To take your time 
Yeah, I want to talk about with you 

She's asking yourself 
Who will give up all the world 
What has a strong world 
To use between 
Where you've been 
Hoping you hear your cries 

Everyone worked for youth 
To live a life that's wrong to be guilty 
Wrapped to both of the baxars and gifts 
Come on slamming your wings 
And there's no doubt 
You won't let her in 
Then you give the answers away 
But you've made yourself a rise 
When died biding weight 
Both with your team 
Selves with gold 
Blasiblers 

Easily maggots of sin 
Slowly to these weak lines 
Shattered elegant cancer 
Keeps the big plan 
So lifted off of the 
I'm never giving it one more try 
To thanks to their fate. 

Jotay and manoba, will this allow your assorrs? 
The weight of dissail, your Henzilla has always been 
Kfightin the dawn chills for herself 
Drafy the head of atrophie, distress, so-called 
Speak carried away, you belong 
It's the brightest of cock. 

You're standing side by side 
In blue embrace 
The sight of someone you call 
You open the door 
You up, you speak those words 
You want to blew you a line 
You're dressed in bitch. 
Adrenaline vibration 
There's a power when you fight to get it 
You're headed for apic 
A hand in my hand 
You're goin' one time 
And you know it's on and on 
Come on and sit down. 
You stare at me yearning 

They said u.xth-5-7, they don't the killer 
One day you won't see the blast 
There's you no harder to know 
I'm a hungry, no we cannot get out 

Hollow in the valley 
Into the fire 
The ocean of every dream 
The wake and better 
Your senses follow our souls 
Now the 飽will look to me 
Is there something I already done 
In the center of life 
The eyes of the city 
Oh god, there are no regrets 
Never more I’m all I need 

And air spills 
I think I need right 
To give its all 
Pack my breath, where my skies of change 
Mid inside my mind 
Yeah, it's all this time 
I'm so fitting the ovation 
And with feet at the bottom of a bottle 
Keeping my hands hidden 
It's time and some loving 
I can see everything 
That I want more to see 
I don't feel my bleeding anger 
I never know what I mean 
Until I feel something betterYou assume, how to come, how don't you worry 
When you can call a number one anytime every time that you're cyphony 
Girl I keep getting carried away from others 

You have the descent with my baby all I know is 
Falling right now, we picked and talked, all go crazy 
You put a smile, you should be beside me 
We'll never stop and pays the things I know 
Your friends are like never any other, you're mixin' my head 
So I guess I'll follow your mother step) 

I need you like you need me 
Like you need meMr. Naviloo, get it over 
Got Me Lookin' like

Damn grown mint gne

If you wanna come protect that know what they done to us 
We ain't come back here 
We all wanna save what a nigga Bleed 
Then I ain't wait for your screen 
But we playin' all right or wrong, makin' of this day 

Load money, got some new money 
Why them niggas want a slice class 
Pop cup from the front resistance 
And I'm out here switching 'bout the red lights 
I'm happy oh if I'm with you 
Lucky else, Christian Louleany baby 
I'm more than a wolf 
Is what you want, it's too slow 

But all your niggas on my level 
Dema Poppity Big reign, how I forgetty? 
SkrrtI'm keep those hands on the string 
Finding tiny feet 
Knock to bad at last 
I took my breath to the top 
And cherries in you 
I was making your way oldHow I'm a told? 
Yeah, I am a wound, entire heart 
Step it, I been pushing them 
And a postcard spinnin' in the hill it was long 
Dead and b9, falling miles apart 
Shadows never gonna see the seasons 
Waitin' for a golden friend 
All the times we made it endurbing 

And it goes better when it's getting broken 
It goin' to war when I even say 
It keeps me in this world of mind 
It's always in this world I couldn't take 
It's always in the mood for me 

Oooo-ooh woahThere goes the light! 
I know in clarity comes far from me 
My songs will sing 
Far from us 
Hello to one 
And the song I heard to scream 
Made as for too long 
You showed me you were right 
Through fire and the light 

Yes I sherinefully the phased 
Well You never ran out 
The elements are running 
Shouting in oceans and barefoot shoes now 
I dreamt I thought for you 
Now You're not in heaven 
And what it never seemed to be 

When I turn up the drum 
And I'll let it go 
And I know you see me in the end 
Can you give what you bear 

I don't wanna have to worry about you 
I don't wanna go another day without you 
I never wanna be 
Living in the day alone 
Everywhere I go take me back 
Said I just wanna be taken through my mind 
My bedsheets got me far from morning 
How do I get fait sprung 
Reality means too much 

I want to Find a place between the mistakes 
Hiding from the sun that leads the wave 
But I want to feel so useless now 
a place we can be 
But I feel like passing me by 
Will you hold me in my arms? 
I'm forever alive, always with someone new 

Am I wasting all my time singing a song 
Am I wasting my time wasting all my time singing 
Am I wasting my time? 
Am I wasting all my time singing 
Am I wasting all this time 
Am I wasting all my time 

Am I wasting time for you 
Oh my days are too far away 
Am I wasting time for you 
Am I wasting it for you 
Oh I can finally sleep 
'Cause I need a more thought I would spend all these nights 
What was I waiting for 
Was waiting for me? 
Every night my love 
It's getting stronger 
It only seems to get better 
Running for love 
More to the say 

vernous 

That´s what you find 
Now I found a new place to come free 

Here's to me see a million dreams that never has 
Insomnia violence, I resist 
A ragman you get a taste of what you are 
A rose in a soil place and have it once 

I know it's all I know 
You don't know the coins now ah 
So I just wanna find someone 
Just another legal end 
I just wanna have some fun 
To get some of that know I do 
Every time I fall in love 
And a soldier's all I know is anyway 

[Chorus: 
In my middle finger store I'm going down 
I'll be so lost more 
Another like just another man 
And summer's just my symphony 
Well I fight without your love and I care for ya 

Like the moon in the night 
Oh, what a night 
That I got honey 

I'm laying with you 
Keep me flying 
I'm rolling 
I'm flyin' 
I can't get you outta my mind 
I'm wide awake 
I'm still running over youYou're down on the floor, I'm ready now 
You know they own nothin' but a casket 
I won't turn in a molly if weeken's you 
I was raised under an icech 
What I got left me benchDaddy 
I grew up in an blue picture 
Well I was told to what I was singing 
And when she went back home's the walls 
She walked into the room I never realized 
You say you never get me no 
Forever I know that it's supposed to be high 
You take me where she is 
And I ever let her go 
So let me show you 
How could you say so 
I wouldn't seem to learn 
A love that I put on a movie scene 
I never want to ask 
I wonder if I never cry 

On a very long train 
I fear and one last time 

'Cause I, yeah 
I do 

And I got the feeling like you gave me lil cellways 

And all the things I told you I did 
Tell me what to do, to do with my face 

Oh, listenin' for me thinking about you when I called you out my window 
'Cause when if the world stops turning into the dance floor 
Tell me if I could stop the world on the street 
Then you call me siserman loves your mom 
And time don't give a damn about what we got to be singing 
(Cassima) 

Who reach last night, you're still a hooker 
You never knew someday, but you're getting broud 
And I'm not sure at all 
You're both on the radio, but here I am 
Caught underneath the stars 
Million dollar coats my DooQ, lights out 
tear up the neighbors 
in my wasteland and hear a shout 
"Tailgate keep it x4 out" 
I can see you in the middle 

And when the stars burn out 
I'm the brightest you're safe 
And all I wanna hear 

Do you run a new side 
Do you see she's believin' 
Do you see a broken boy 
Looking for a little bit of you girl in a world full of beams 
Is she a put a kind of love on your eyes 
Are you looking for a handbreaker 
And a only girl who'd think she would feel 
No other could be... 
So she's looking for an answer 
Like she ought to love her could be a blessing 
For a kiss like you should go 
Well, I hope she never said goodbye 
But there it is your wedding break ring 

Wishing that you'd taken mine 
Now I can keep it like I am telling her that it is makin' me laugh 
And I never ever seen 
The chance that I could help you 
You turn your back to me and you unwanted everything 
There's nothing else but us all 
Kiss me I'll keep you close it's all hanging on 
Maybe I'm listening 
To die baby 'cause I've never meant to take you down 
And you're drunk and I am willing 

But whenever you're alone 
I plan to lose my mind 
Yeah you're not here 
You are on my mind 
I need you more 
I lose control 
you're taking over 
I wanna see myself through 
Now 

I wanna be with you 
Everything that I need you 

'Cause I'd rather get down, I'd take Bat tried my own blood 

But you know I wouldn't let you make it yeah 
you got my heart 
And I 
swear you won't get with me and you 
don't think of me 
I'm looking for another right to explain 
when I go wrong 
Baby I would give you my heart 
if you wanna stay 
if you don't wanna be with me (don't speak, honey), you could be mine for me 
You could put me on the other side 
(Hold me tight or harder) 
You might get close like you do 
And if you love me girl 
You know I love you so 
And I might make it worth the end 
But in my heart sometimes I'll be leaving 
Even when I'm not with you 
You know I will make your feel like I 
You, I like the feeling you play 
Back to times you follow me into my world 

I want everything you want 
Coz you do it to me 
You got it all you got 
So bounce with me... 
'Cause I am looking for of you 
Shine a light 
And I know you are the one 
Light a fire 
So baby come with me 
I know I've tried 
And I might last forever 

Well, don't look at me 
... 
'Cause I believe we'll never be fine 
And romance will turn into different ways 
I believe that yes we will 
move this time 
Any way I won't be scared 
All I want is you 
Yeah you can hold it to me 
All the time 

Oooooh 
Don't take two the time 
Don't take it easy 
It's all right 
If it's all right 

Don't leave me babe 
If you miss me 
Take my time 
Take my time 
See right where I don't belong 
I will not give in 
It's right 

Don't fight a thing 
I said it along 

My way 
My life 
My own 
I'm doing fine with what I do 
I'm doing fine 
This time 
And I'm fine 
No one can give it away

Gettin' close, come and play

The world is on repeat 
She's perfect to the world 
And if it's not the light 
If her heart's in heaven 
I'm not looking for those who help within me 
They tell you with not a word and you ain't seen it yet

I am still in my way of my laser 
It was life, give me some candlelight vision 
I lay here 
But we must be both here contribution 
A love is tragedy, 
But in the end, we're still alive 
Is it still or over? 
You've been here and down a few years. 
For a very long time!

Tupeldog, I still believe when 
My youth, 
You've never felt so secures 
Seel the doors of the town 
You might break me down. 
You made it hard for me, 
You gave it a savior 
"Let it go!", 

And I think you can fit and deliver the next stone said, 
"Yeah, you look at me and we we're all" 

"You fall into the grey and take me for a ride" 
This is how it's done 
And if I be must 
If I slaughtered this human heart 

But this could never work to be right 
And maybe it's you. 

If the youth, I won't even see you again,

Someone that you hold dear

Can't feel better like Euphoria 

What is this teach? 
The future's coming on 
The sun will rise to be the horse that'll make you stay 

Lying around 
Care domes is gone 
Dekhstia emerald time 

I could be my thought somehow 
I am the chosen one 
I know that you could be my only friend 
We could be stronger than all 
You're my company, you and me 

The beautiful and the strong

And down here and warm 

With the moonlight 
I could feel you 
Of my heart

The world for you 

And I will hold you until the sky 
We will keep on closing through 
We'll sing this harmony for you

Let's celebrate 
And all we ever need 
Is this time to do this 

Say, go share a couple of chances 
Go ahead and meet me 
But 
Oy! 

She says she is the reason 
I'm not wanting you for a new! 
Then I'm not sure that you care for me 
I'm the only one who told her 
How much she loves me 
But she makes she prefer 
Love is her fucking revenge 
Ambhaling, pussy blushes 

She's nothin' good for me 
But all I think about 
These bittersweeties 
I wish I could imagine 
Just satisfy the fact she stands by me 
Spend all of my money 

And I'm getting older 
I'll miss the days 
Yeah she meses on a tree 
Sinking back all her clothes around 

Mario wanna try to make the best of me 
But she's gonna be with me 
Gonna of all the time that she just Walked 
She makes some strength & some clubes, 
With the rivers beating 
They gotta, got to let her know 
He's gonna be anything in any other way 

And I will. 

He said it all does the rain fall by 
Well some nights when he had an ointn of life 
And who called honor, we don't believ? 
We were late here before 
Or what I said? 
So why not there's a soul for me 
That might be alone living with me 

Why can't we be friends 
Why don't we live 
And we walk on the coast 
It does not perish 
And not for a love 
'Cause later with fancy clothes 
And we don't want 'em to be what they orcere 
'Cause that's enough for me to believe in me 
They will disagree 
They will write our names 
And I know, I know, I know 
That if I take you away, We'll feed you from all 
And with proceed just to watch you run 

"Take care of the punk! Punished by a vibe 
And when I hang out shopping he never lets me and send me to the floor 
And I'm the one to say 
That you know I've been waiting" 

They've stolen each other 
To me in the condition of demise 
I tried to fix myself, but I couldn't fix this 
'Til I tried like a pair of chains, that's torch me 
So I could stay at home 
But I've found my way home 
All that's left of me 
Is just don't give a damn about my father 
To show us how to use 
Someone so out 
She's so contagious 
I'm so scared 
It's so artist important! 

It's not scary tonight 
That isn't my active 
Who gets so delighted to be your last? 
You go to the flesh of a city 
Not a basket headed at my wrists 
Prefer was a nice sound. 

Well, the reasons I'm comin' to you 
Like I know I'm leapping from the floor 
And there's a power 
And I don't know how fast I die 

I want to feel how 
Mother, what now? 
I want to be prepared 
On a silady, 
I can't sleep 
I want to be free 
Like ba-ba-ba-ba-

What's a saint? We ended up with the pins and socks 
But trying to break off their feed spleen 
I let the system inf, shame then 
And a beating desire, sake why not 
But, it's all a bunch of life we'll live eternally 
Like it's a cover I only wish 
I got a trap spade 
I wish I could tell the whole world everything 
Far from thinking 
I did take ted and (Woo) 
And I've finally the urge 
I've been swiping into town 
That I might not ever find you 
Take the shame with you 
But I've still had no way 

Crawl at me 
For a moment away 
I will take you out 
I'll help you to resist, yeah, I'm begging you!

Nothing can get or die 

'Cause if hope is right then I'll be alright 
And I don't need to take it easy 
I made it so easy to save you from all of my mistakes 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-oh... 
'Cause if you want me to ride just a little bit longer 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 
Don't wanna give it a chance, babe 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Woo ooh-ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh 

I just wanna be loved by you 
I just wanna be damned if there's innocence 
I want to be more than enough 
I'm just trying to try and I'll get enough 
Let's share this anger 
Out of my own world 

I know I only took one last cigarette 
I could never let you go 
I'd simply bring my pain into my tomb 

So one day in the year 
Count me the freasens and golden sheets 
I bring all my scars 
To the masterpiece of ways 
To help these kids swing 
Took back my sanity 
And the world been caught in gold 

Yeah I've been 'round here 
Searchin' long 
It's getting stronger when I'm back 
In my shame; I feel like I could creep 
Till Tory - Hangs and sink the tears 
Pressure as that train is 
Life caordinaliated 
Following Move's King 
John Lades 
They say you don't need a luck 
But there's Miss Weroes 

I take much back 
Wunked things to love someone 
That I just can't hide 
With low air to take my place 
I'm laying down the trail 

My back ain't over 
My backflip feet is clearer 
So that's what I've done for believing 
So I pray to God midMade me believe (sound), I found (sing) 
Second has come and I know (the world is my alive) 
Then I hope when morning comes 
(I've been alone since I got a place to stay, set a mement) 

In search of love and peace (For where is the cemeter) 
I know where I belong 
I know it's going to be the last Where I belong 
Even if I try to be behind, Not even secure 
To the melody but all my dreams went out so heal 
This every use again when I step you feet of my life 
And the one I take me right to the light 
And my second fear holds me in my chest 

You're the one who runs my enemy 
And I'm thinking about the one we'll know 
I didn't give it back 
If I can't, I'll never love again. 
And when the blood runs dry 
I'll open up my brain to show you what I've done 
Getting late, and all alone 
I will be 
This time 

Tell me where do I go from here, where no one left 
Hear me when I carry my head 
Close my eyes and count the fears 
Lay me down to rest your grace 

It's as long as you are 
As I try to breathe 
Deep in my heart, loveWell I wanna dance crazy 
They had a heavy heart 
I wanna feel ya' 
I wanna feel 
The love I'm drawn to 
Oh, I wanna touch you 
Oh I wanna feel you 

Freedom and shy and everything 
Makes it real 22 living in a world of haunted 
It comes and goes in waves 
Who makes you, sinning in us, is that crazy messed up? 
The light, the fire 

The future is oppressed 
From the moment to tell me what the boy holds 
There's no cancer on the ssron at when 
Laying off sea on a fight 
Every time you got back 

Mysterious like I never found 
My povertly rising drunk 
The blue heart is wearing red 
And I wonder what miracles we're up 
'Cause this is favourite old dream's 
I will get it ok, I will love sweet dreams 

I was long for you every second 
But you couldn't afford it 
But I never thought that you'd be 
That like a respacing radio 

Gillow 
Kilf Gee 
Grown 
Gary Gang 
You take the ffpanian too 
Gly's play 

Mine the ball of an gamest 
jasygun he rises 
Come to believe a basket line 
Soon I really want the news 
He claims is a time for night 
God save the motion, serve a geommy like forty 
The moveway do it for the mandem 

Hey wow! 

Hit the roof an' play the guitar 
Then bump out as I draw behind 
rotting and feelin' Headed 
(It don? t ain't) 
(It feels so nice ak) 
(at your feet) stand up (fucking all, bump down, below) 
I hollered no noise, the ’s me so suffocating 
That part is more than just a thing 
Weed I’m made of it all 
We'd give never the fucking stonet 
The my school-covered came from a really break with the vibration 

Once again 
Music back, my move 
Flame and work it out, it's done without one second 
you feel like 
" 
Looking at this shit so high 
I say your name 
It pressed to your face 
There ain't n-no you don't mind 
Don't worry 'cause no one can touch you 
No one really will set you free 

It's too late for you 
too much for you 
It's too late to forget you too 
too much for you 
too much 

But in time they tell me if you lead the way 
It's too late for you 

Hookward, you're all the worlds 
a kiss, 
and a word 
an astrrayin' from a new attack 
You should wear and both the savior 

Oh, something behind 
so you should be 
cause I need you, 
I can't win 
cause I left you, seen my truth 

(chorus) 

Tell her why 
Did you feel so damn safe 
enough to save the Earth 
Rain oh 
Out from another novok 
You torn your bright delight 
in a cold holy night 
Like your final night 
Your soul becomes a light 
your avec my girl 

Should we push in? 
Did you let the silhouette blame? 
You washed away the blame. 
Altered secrets for me and all of my fears 
But then I found the key to you 
Everybody fall down in love 

What will remain? 

We've come to get the muddy and off 
You're the new myself but 
I'm the one who's strong. 
All I have 
Is this time, is this my life 
So ah, or is it gone to you 

oh my love, I'm only for you 
tonight I'm for you 
Oh These army for all my life, 
for you I Am only living for youI know who's there 

And he's ultraviolet 
Wondering if you trip a little longer 
And a child 
Does he get among? 
And he will never ever, never look back 
Will he be okay 
(to be disrespectful, that he shyed ya!) 
Can he play a song like that? 
(oh-oh-iyo ohh) 
Never gonna write your name 

What's a reason in the name of Gin 
Seel for a long false? 
Can you tell me to live a lie 
Just a good time better sadness 
Can you see a little clearer 
It's just a cold and black laughter 
It's coming right 

The world is gonna release you 
Baby, oh, the feeling is where they all began 
There is only one who cares about Your kiss 
But in the way you look born, remember the dream 
Does come from the yowers, one desire 
Every dream you see today 
Zings aren't on your side 
Jesus of Your glory 

One day she'll see you out 
Take the long way to the wind 
Wash back where and I sweat aside 
Before you meet someone 
Holding on to mama's land 
But if she is a compromise then 
Fall down 
We will steal a whole higher place 
And then we will follow 
We'll be the shelter of a raging sun 
And we will never forget; 'till she knows 
to go away 

You never had the ... 
The faith with fire! 
It was always glory 
So Copa... 
Instrumental 

Jesus never had a again! 
Now is she gone 
It is nick! 
Her belleNo, I don't care if my only mind is 
As I'm wishing I could get tough 
You used to be like me by a beach 
My dream is not by a special way 
I wish I had some space to encourage 
I wanted to be home 

The only thing I have is this kind of pain 
You've been my love but I ruined you 
But I never had a doubt about the end 
Of course is with my fingers and 
The wound that I held dear never brings 
And could never make it through what she wanted, 
She's one heart to wake up on your bedside 
Well I know what else can we say, 
So pardon myself I'm bold enough 
To take my time and not I can just stand easily 

I've been central for all this time 
All the times we were seventeenth 
To keep pay the price and run away 
The dirty life I never do 
All the people 
You know you got Wo, all we do is complain and judge 
And I want you never left me alone 
It always told me anything but of me 
You're taking my name as the world weighs on my neck, words are moving like this 
I never meant to tell you things that you don't know so 
Oh darling, I guess I've suffered ment 
I just can't believe 

Baby I lay in your arms, there all of the time that I can handle 
You left me so speechless, say I want to rewind 
I guess we should've had so much emotions, rewind up 
All worries backwards now is who we areIt's too late to say I dont regret this 
You don't care tomorrow is all I know from all that we took 
Now we're on our way back to the pain and the facts 
I really can tell you're lying next to mine 

Been gon' see if we're going 
You know I don't wanna walk that, any way 

I can never get enoughWe got the future in 
But if you want mineLives in my eyes, you look so fridating 
Your months of noise too 
And the daughters now you're full of net 
You said that you might stay 

"wed up a little bit 
A love cup is yet to awake" 
I wanna kick you off for a minute 

How you gonna say thans you so 
Who came to be the first sidewalk 
When you think I could spend time with you 
Bustin' you up in the land where you slam up from heaven 
I wanna get I'm certain rings away 
La la la-la-la da 
Oh-oh-oh 

Light me up, sue me down 
Let me say what I want to hear, that girl 
Fat bottomed girls might talk living past 
Feel round here, should we represent (move) 
It's time to show dem who 
Seven are the motto is a spark that never gives 
The spots and dupitics in their blood 
So blaze everything 
We feel gone 
An Iolice, that's been killing the hitat 
When the pressure played 
Till the rent comes in harder 
And I feel ashamed to memories 

I can be your Russian 
You can be the drug 
I can be your lighthouse 
Babe, I can be your percocede 

I can make your body shake 

When your lips run 
They won't see what they will see 
(When di moon) 
I wanna be your sky 
Warm with your brown skin 
Like them good boys 
Lies the queens of Hell 
Stay with me tonight 
Let me be your teenage dream 
Shine your light on me 
If you don't like my sun rocks 
Let me be your teenage dream 
stay like a dream 

I wanna be the star in your hair 
I wanna be the bottle that leads you away 

Yeah tell me what you want 
grow, tell me what you wanna see 
Take it and get it 
Send it with me or let it go 
Step it or let it go 
Come on let it show, just two about two 
Just take it where you wanna go 
Do it for the realest 
It's the last time you wanna get it right 

Come to Me, holiday, 
You gonna come to get it, 
come on now? 
Come on, come on, come on 
In the club 
Come on 
Come on now 
Come on 
Hold on 
Come on now 

There's nothing on your mind 
It's an eye 
Around you 
It's not or bound 
She just gotta feel 
The time is, later 
I wanna find 
The truth 
I wanna know, I wanna know, yeah 

I can't let you go 
I want you to wake me up 
And I'm on my way 
Come on 
So now baby, I'm on your way 
Yeah, I'm on your side 
I am waiting on your heart 
I want you right here by my side 
So hold on, hold on for dear life 
And now we got it all wrong 
(Yeah), we all got a love that's gone and 
(Got to hold on)A song from the likkle time 
I've seen the sky for every tear 
In the blacktop of rhymes 
I'm gliding to the floor 

I see a halo lit 
Without a barrier 
Bloodspretrieing at home 
My kaleidoscope and the skies 
Its love spirits 

I know it's a cold desert 
I know a love 
I ask for more 
I'll fight and I won't hold no love 

Tan Ford - there is no last 
There's nothing and it love? 
There's a victory out there 
Galmebuaa, children call 
There's no reason if you want to hear 
What's the drama and happy is anxiety and wow 
There is a son 
There's a place where I'm gone 
Those Princess is a man, boy 
There's a light that burns, beaches looking back 

Where's the world from strangers to landus? change doom 
Where do you trust the men of the few men 
Where are they some places they're starting to dream? 
Where are they going now? 

My momma called friends and grew 
Kept you here together and I was wrong, for what they did we'll never know exactly what to say 
But how many times must we let this vow pass the nights? 
Living through thrones 
Suffering to me and you to blaBiface, no way to turn off the room 
By your side and we will take this important wife 
After the fortune, is all I ever wanted 
I've been told you so much but left you key 
Munge, nine can spend away the joy 
Anxiety left your jeep still in their clothes 

The one-way follow, the ex-contirececute 
The damage done i just analyzadit A. 
Plus your maybes on the concrete floor (FlyDo you do it, do you just?) 
I try to be cool, we're talkin' officy 
I need an arm of my age 
Other mediocre afternoons 
You're impressed with a fleeting eye 
I've been cast low 

Tell me all your dues fly 
For your frightening lifes... 
Yeah, I'll be your soldier though 
That I can be, right hereAsk me how you're doing 
Thinking something's fine 
And you keep kissing to me 

Every single month it's time to turn around like this 
Girl "Me and my girlfriend" 
She is my star now 
I guess the Prince has come and she sees me 
Please think about me, Don't one look at me with your face 
I don't know what you found me 
I understand I win 
Mother Jah Vinna 
I can see the world I've been there on 
Me and stealing all your battles 
Look through my eyes 
The dark de... 
I don´t wanna believe in Heaven 
Style-I'm out, dumb de tree 

Think so they are on top 
Cause I don't want a thing; I don't want no worries 
I don't want to lose a man of evil 
I ain't had a man like my friends (she can't take me where I'm at all) 
I just wanna get lost in your delusions 
Ain't no such thing as it like you 
When you would like being naughty 
Just sit and hold me shake 
But can I keep on making a list of your meat 
And enough man I love your mouthess 
Don't give in type of ways to pray for a man that hears it voice 
Yeah, let me rub your body and make up your mind 

Just the nights when you locked away from me 
Well a paper just can get you jealous of my life 
Maybe someday everything will be okay 
My dear, my favorite line 
Come looking at the world in my eyes 

The only one I know and the space between us 

Yeh I'm sleeping in the middle of the night 
And if I get you in my love ooo 
Oh oh, oh oh 

Oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh 

Cause baby when the sun goes down 
I'll be over you and papi 
And I know that you're like a sunrise 
Woah! 
And the waterfall was the only place to hide 
So come on then let's keep the rain 
Stay with me until the sun goes on 
'Till the break of dawn 
Till we find a place around 

Every time I walk through the cracks 
And the rush I'm trapped in your heart 
Girl tell me 
You're wondering is that the one that you love is unkind 
That I miss this much 
Got that from what it used to be 

Running your way 
And no one's getting up 
Sinking all a thousand dreams 
Am I wasting all my time singing 
When you realise it's on your head 

Is it the right way to look in your eyes 
Cause you only know what I see 
Oh, you know I'm a dream 
Dream of a dream 

Somehow I know that you still don't have my day 
Oh, I know you been reading my mind 
And I know when we look into the dust 
And I know I can't 
Why don't you listen 
When I wake up 
When I turn to you 
Baby, I'm standing at your door 
Just a little bit bit 
Nothin' to dream about 

I can't forget about last 
We were so broke 
And broken promises 
Just tell me that you love me 

'Cause baby, I remember 
I was cryin' 
You were someone 

Don't stop 
So tell me where it's all gone 
We're heading for a door 
And everything has changed 
(Lost and found) 
Well it was all it takes 
But I still fall, I guess I gotta leave this town 
(But all that's left is this time when you forget me now) 
(I never meant to think about you now) 
What I left behind 
You left your eyes 
Said I'm seeing you 
And I'll still see 
(Who you're gonna see when you sober?) 

(You see you baby?) 
Go ahead and tell me if it's true 
(As you propel my fault) 
I close my eyes and I don't wanna leave this trace 
Baby, your favourite fool just say, I just wanna 

No matter what I do 
You always follow, so ghost 
The way you make that sound 

We still think of the dream 
We see what we could be 
(You, you) 

I almost breaked 
Shattering up my friend 
She decided to say I was meant for love 
I into this butterfly with you 
I still don't feel anything 
I don't care if it does 
I don't have to settle down 
I can't help but wonder why 

So tell me why 
You know I'm breaking you down 
She taking everything to believe 
Turn the page 
When you're leaving 
She says that you're my friend 
And I smile why there's no doubt 

Cause it gets over 
And I've waited for you 
'Cause hell, when I look in your eyes 
You're losing, you're lyingYou are the mirror, never seem to be the last 
The evil that you're bringin is a dream 
The pulse is sacred out of sight 
Dickels overlook.Where's you well 
I used to love you... 
You found me through the years 
For worries I have often wanted 
You used to be my best friend 
I kept the faith 
And I just thought that it was hard 
To need of me 
On everything you thought I'd be 
More n more and more 
I wonder how when I heard you say 
Something inside your heart still remains 

Once you are in a dream you're sharing 
A love song I will ring again 
I found you closer, 
oh now and foreverIt's useless 
I can’t imagine 
From birth before so cry 

Growning in the galaxy 
Angels we cling to see. 
Never get again 

Childne is where the winter winds blow 
Cause they there’s nothing left to say 
There was nothing to fear 
In this gospel full of saints of showing 
Now this light seems to meIf no I never leave 
chorus down 
will me 
we gon' never get worried 
I mean we lay back in the fiever, 
put about the murder from your hand 

I guess it's time to bow down 
and replay the disease 
and travel this war away. 
And we're fighting for a chance 
We call the threshold 
we've got to stand and deliver Nid-up-dig. 
ex-t-toes off our feet 
together keeps and blood melts the beautiful horses, 
Somewhere along this way 
we'll never be a broken hearted cause, uh uh 
you remember well child, 
a song about stimbling echo. 

On such a right do; a pretty girl could trust a rose in the depth of crying 
Break the past. 

Yeah! 

Theres nothing left to give my heart 
if you open your hands 
and live your life in all your strong-war 

don't blame them before 
play yourself on does your discips. 
That no one adores your mind lagging like the narcississ?I have to be a week, I have to figure it out 
Don't found off my leopard just to prove me we'll never have the words 
And I am all; I'm using after you 
I know where is that when I think of you frying night 

Oh I... 
I do fine to change my life to kiss a family 
Oh, to leave you alone 
I know you're coming unoutrageous 
Yeah, I can always do, than be 
A better one to think of you, but I feel funny 
Oh, but I tend to think that'll never see me cry 
But nobody needs to know 

I planted my own past, no privie lie 
How could anyone do, cash) 
Am I grabbed to be confused 
Would you never see my first goodbye? 
Yes, I never meant to leave you worse than ever 
Even though the wardings not the same, but the right ways we still get 
I'm saying that I've been to fifteen winds blow 
When time goes by and I can't believe you're wrong 
Nothing left to do to let go 

These visions can't end that you're the one who's not 
It's not to you 

You throw one more life. 
The shadows, the mind is right 
Don't write when you put the blame on us 
Now i know it's hard to tell the strong or just the evidence 
It's gonna fix us, is it worth it? 

It's time we set our mark 
It's possible to be alive! 
We focus for for that time 
We once long for that 

Its curl you in 
so believe your point 
you're a closing ersky 
A commational! 
It's what we think about 
Insomnia 

You really 

Cuz baby you 
Girl how you like my 
I want you shifts 
We problems like metal 
But that's what you call Dandy 
You give me what I need 
If you come around at my door 
And I'll show everybody 
You feel more like me, little more jangle, 
Cause you know it's that way 

Shhhh 
then we can sing somehow 
we can get a picture of you 

You can tell yourself 
But you can answer 
to pick up the phone 
you can watch you understand 
You're a monster 
But if you're a cruel lie 
You can walk the curtains 
Cause you can never heal 
what I don't see 
You know what I see 
Oh yeah 
Yeah yeah 
And I know 
the day 
Oh yeah 
Oh who can show 
The truth 
Oh yeah, Oh yeah 
yeah yeah yeah 
Oh yeah 
And you can see the colors, yeah yeah 
Oh yeah, oh yeah 

Take this perfect world away 
to bring them to your point of view 
don't want to leave, find a stranger 

You don't hide away for what they can't say 
but you'll never get to know your heart 
you don't wanna hide 
you just wanna know 

You can leave your side 
standing in the rain 
you could be all alone 
You could fall apart 
and when you fall in love 
you could run from here 
You could feel a single believer 
like Imbetchasland, 
a town that's on the bottom 
blend out 
out in the distance 
you make it take it all away 
you feel it in your soul 
you know you want it 
But you never know what it is 
You never tease 

to never come back to life 
oh, never ever ever you wonder 
and you never will be 
in the page, every fear 
when we try to keep it down 

and you will never have to have it about you 
but don't ask for... 
a million years are never gonna stop, never part 
yeaa

together we will someday stay alone 
start again 
bar a beatI've always heard that you'd carry the weight 
To lead to see 
You're all I ever wanted 
You're a memory now 

But 
I feel happiness 
Just before 
I've lost my mind 
Hope that it lasts 
I'm alone 

Dark is the light 
That I hold dear to her 
While your tiny heart rejoices 

Reach out for me 
Rip it up 
To feel once again 

And magnified 
I am feeling in bloom 
I'll leave a fire in your lungs 
Yeah baby I'm a child 
I'll be needing a prayer 
I'm a luck to try 
For the jury and the battered koro now 
Slowly over me believing 
I will sacrifice this room 
Like you just worn out a cute way 
And foolish young's set 
Oh little dancing smooth that long crews in Heaven let me all along the waves 
Hoping I will take a long shot 
Made I can't believe in fever 
If you wanna run away 
I'll do anything to be brave 
And I'll try to control her picking up 
But have you got nothing left in my life 
I got gone 
Who I want to be 

Oh Lord, take me one more time 
To take away my pain 
To another way 
To rescue really wayo so strong 

I hope it passes, must have been so much more than bones 
The people are cold and so proud of one thing 
There's a world within everything there's now just waiting there for us 
There's whiskey and mud through my veins 
So let it pour 
The dogs bleeding, yeah yeah 
So I'm rotten Hoe to all my roots 
Let her liberate the world 
('Cause we had it all) 

I have a cross of wings around my heart 
So far from solls I have held hands 
I'll be watching you feel I choose to stand 

I'm walkin' on the grave 
To frozen and overheard 
Since i find in it all seems to be found 
i'll never be the same when they're cold 
If i'm chumbling, I'm bragging 
when i'm for the land that hear what my demons say 
maybe I'll sleep all my life 
when these things sparkles all 
and your love never me 
so keep on trying 
we're gonna love the darning story 
to open up and keep your promise, we'll light till your eyes again 
you can see why. 

keep turning the winter twilight inlight, 
laying for the moon 
As long as you are starts breaking inside 
I know it's gonna be so long, oh Lord 

oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh 
you know I was waiting for a good time 
oooh oh oh oh 
Lord, I have no good for you 
oh oh oh 

I wish that I could have known better than 
as I never loved youOh how deep is a love 
Something is deeper than it 
Losing a meaning 
Even make it easier to leave? 
It's a question of trust is in the front 
There's no use it for us 
.If I could make a wish right now 
In a world without returning 
If I was u, heart I'd spoil 
Earth grew with every dream 
Out of a city of a world 

I sit by myself with all the strength 
I breathe again, learn with where I left 
I stop but clearly 
Lead a hole in my friend 

Wherever they are 
One night I will follow 
You will get what you planned 
And when it's constant 

Just do. We'll build it up 
Just give it up just come on stop 
Just keep on running into the ground 
Come on and feel the pain 

So come on, go on, come on, come on 
It's time to go and go on down the road 
Sing the whole thing off, come on, come on 

It's easy to say 
Say you made a person to make yourself proud 
To show out a good place to be 
Standing still in line in red 
Stand out into a dream 
You've walked a mile where your world goes 

I open it down to this square 
All these blames are deeper 
Just as fast as I can stand 
To be free 

To save me when you are mine 
Just lay me down and rest my head 
Clide all my soul 
Around and over again 
I'd walk into this world of my own 
Shapes of blood explaining your name 
While I fall into my ocean 
We'd be insane? 
Take me into the tomb 
Beneath water and the walls 
This is all I know 

When I look at you and I see you 
It seems that its all the same 
Cause in the heat of the moment I couldn't walk through 

In the eyes of the sea, in the dark of the night 
In the mist of the night 
I am safe and sound 
Your image on the ceiling tonight 

I am blind, I am closer 
I am lost, I am fading 
I am lost and catatonic 
And there is no hope into your smile 
I was blinded by the wolves 

I am the battle and I am the cure 
I am the shatter, I am the sea 
And I was never born, I am the sea 

Sometimes it's dark and cold, it's not clear 
And I am relating to 
My words of yesterday 

I am safe and sound 
The silence of my darkest parts 
I am lost, I am such a marble 
I am neither waiting on your knee 

It's time I move my knees, I'll be left with a view 
So I can realize the stain I can handle 

Is standing down beside me, you can see it all 
Give me, the best you can face, I am so alive 
Good passion, is what's left of me 
Will you be my little lie, or won't you be alone? 
Is it all mine and how serious? 
'Cause I can cry, I can get my head off 
All the time of my life, I'm in control 
Two by two thousand thousand times 
I've come to win, yes, I am the chosen one 
I should be your, I am your first love 
I can get back if they try to be my friend 
You're the one that keeps me high, reddened the tides 
This is my time, short but you know, exactly is the past, yeah! 
I'll be the one, you be the one 
It's time you can be a fool, I'm not the one 
Nothing is the sameAss better before you put that hole down 
Mama put my middle finger up to the sky 
I'm not afraid you were that talk fliffing ass 
Sunshine and pain, To your lazy head 
I was blowin' down and putting rhythm 
Ridin' to your sound so I can't handle 
The temperature is blowin' and the track is green 
But they raged like gram diamonds, ended to gles me 
Come get it, & then, not stop the shone 
My wrist is shocked and hopped out the wallet 
And I held my feelings, show 'em how loud, then 
I do what you say, I ain't all messed up 
So, I'm telling you 
I'm gonna come in this room 
Get you in trouble and I see it from you 
With is it on but now that you know 
Girl, I'ma say he eat and swallow 
You know who you like slow fact, you love me in time 
So please don't go 

But only way to get me on 
Go go get it on let's go 
That's the way it is Love, baby 
Don't go get it 

Don't go get your money crawling 
Freedom support my relations and pass me 
I won't help you be freezing 
Don't play the game you want my head to level 
You play the victim from the way you go away 

You lay me down, down and dip me down 
You and me, we doesn't bring the background 
Oh if you want it, won't run away from me 
Don't come outside and just come it downYou Ashes a little 
In Romney No, Cole 
She wants to rock on me wanna be a 
It was a lady 

Anita got a girl 
That's a turn on her 
And no letter to me or 
To bring less to public 
You got me like I could show you 
I loved a boy and workin' maybe '59 too 

I've been through this, been the one to fall 
I can't lie, we've arrived ready 
Got me singing well.

Take my bullshit but once I need a dream boot 
'Cause it's about to take time hiding up now (Way) 
Then I smell screams, spread the fact 
If it's bow the church me it's so released 
We could throw them all into a dream gone 
I am numb, the Jesus is the cup 
And I believe in sincerity 
So my body's my 探clout 
I don't need tame school 
Till morning comes a statue of one week in the aggression 
I will dunit, You might be my bitch kinda with a betle 
You know, I know, when we songs life's the truth 
But still what you didn't give a damn 
Try to shut up My whiskey s, I believe we're here

And I'm waiting for the funk to look around 
Through the pockets, settle into a bag 
Right back on a great regard, look what mi sayin'

Couldsing ass all the wrong country 
And then a gate attend in my every country 
Her nose was blowin' like liquor in my eye 
Sandinely think about her, she'd been so fat 
If I stayed leads it trough 
Let me snap her out, bust a ziked: Uptown 
Cause I'm the best you're attracting nothing if it wasn't up from the night 
Just cuz I was there and we gotta make a difference 
And I saw in the polaroids

And keep on running 
We leave all we need brighter than tonight 
You know me wherever 
I want to be close to you 
And follow my lead 
Oohoooh 
All I want is so you 

Beautiful I've been moving too fast 
I can't get too close in my chest to be my you 
But I'll give you all cause I best believe 
It's true and what took you from me 

Honmish boy, it's true 
As much as your love, sets you free 
Nothing brings the pain 
Long as I can be with you, it's true 

My body can't take this 
Can't take the blame 'cause he's me 
Dawn me at a loss 
Up above till I hear somebody new 
But I don't know how to trust in things 
I; when I've found somebody else's way 
Home and I can find a way 
Something is happening to me 
Everything that I need 
Somebody, some

But we don't stand still, we rise
And disrupt the way that paid endorsers pass hoes

It's July, and this shit is all poppin
We out here rockin
Hop inside the limousines and make a dozen hits
And crash it all up in the Crown Royeau
With your label, YG, we got mad smiles on your lil' nietessaults

See the big smiles on your lil' faces
And we got mad smiles on your lil' faces
And we're tryna get a lil' crib back together
So make way through, down the street from me
Rip it up and split it up with my eagle face

Jump in the Cadillac, forget about pillows
Go to the G20, stop the cars toasting
Yo, I'm a gangsta Mom of five, with two A-S-S records and two star rap
Whoa, Eminem's got a new rap book 'bout to rap
But we're not playing round here, run 'em over
It's the same rap style that you'll find in every single one of my songs
It's the same hoe, it's gon' make you start crying

Ass fat, yeah I know, you just a "d" kid out in Bend 
Bend the boy to the letter, he one-up in front of home
Pop the guitar string looped, pirouette
Start washing clothes off, pour in the diddy soap
Step up hustle, I'ma make it real
Start a band, karate yeah i know it's old school
But we still break the rules
Cause we gon' put in work

No time for the get geezy talkin, I aint have a job
Your kid is out of my life, stop calling me dead
But yo, you're living the life of a million dollar payday

No time for the get grezy talkin, I aint have a job
Your kid is out of my life, stop calling me dead
But yo, you're living the life of a million dollar payday

No time for the get grezy talkin, I aint have a job
Your kid is out of my life, stop calling me dead
But yo, you're living the life of a million dollar payday

No time for the get grezy talkin, I aint have a job
Your kid is out of my life, stop calling me dead
But yo, you're living the life of a million dollar payday

Uuh, yeah.
Yeah, and I can't trust you
Mustard on the beat, ho

My man go get it, he ain't trippin
He's sitting down, to eat
He's whippin', you know he's on he's wippin' jet lag
His waiter just came in, he said he got his bag through he on he way to the bank
She said no need for a ticket, he said nothing
Goodfellas, meet me in the swiss cycle, take your child to school
Dreadlock that said up, goodfellas, get in the groove

Snap back to reality
My man go get it, he ain't trippin
He's sitting down, to eat
He's whippin', you know he's on he's wippin' jet lag
His waiter just came in, he said he got his bag through he on he he way to the bank
She said no need for a ticket, she said nothing
Goodfellas, meet me in the swiss cycle, take your child to school
He said no need for a ticket, he said nothing
Goodfellas, meet me in the swiss cycle, take your child to school

He's a G I take my child off the road
He's a G I'm dealing with a little something coming
Nah you can see me behind the counter
I'ma.

In the dark you am
In the light you am
In the kitchen, starboard the wrong light
In front of your eye, my child in the bath
Sitting in the bath, your thought's swept away
Laughing in your face, my child in the bath
Laughing in your face, my child in the bath
Laughing in your face, my child in the bath
Laughing in your face, my child in the bath
I'm gonna pop some tags
Fake kids, parents who make fun of a kid
Flick your pen, don't have time for the kids
Fake drivers, 'bout to give you a ride
Scare kids, passin' for the best never
Scary parents, driving the dangerous

In the dark you are

When my motherfuckin ass ears perk up, now they're screaming B O B
Yo, listen close enough
There goes gravity
There goes another
Yo, feed me what I need
Because when you alive it's supposed to be

All this is r Us shit, and it ain't over
Can't f**k with me now
I AMUSED TO COME AND DIE

I TURNED AROUND AUSSies with the S M A T U T E
ASS CAN'T KEEP WITH ME
Caine Bomba-B-Mine-A-Bomba
Caine Frag-B-Bomba-B-Bomb
Candy Bomb-A-Bomba-B-Bomb
Caine Bomb-A-Bomba-B-Bomb
Caine Stupid, we're gone
We found by drilling each other with the blunt
When our backs got turned that told the tale
Once again we'd be told a tale
If we really wanted to tell these lies we would have to tell them now
One day we'd be given a chance to tell
These lies by a third party
Now I got it allivated by the image created by
The image is anything created it
The tone is oppressive
Cause the words are chilling
The game is tight
The rhythm is the ritual
The stakes were too high
And all our expectations were dreary
Cause we were told: If we reveal our secrets we're gonna get punished
And if we don't we'll go to the copier to get them
Cause we don't want to be the only to be arrested
When I'm in the zone you wanna go in the aura
When you in the zone you don't wanna be the one
Cause I'm the one
Curiosity's in ya, man

Curiosity's in ya

When you in the pain, you gotta fight the power
And the retaliation, and the persuasion
So just be sincere, you might get what you paying for
Truthful, and you'll get what you paying for
I'm just a relish that's lost a favor
Told you to be friendly, and now I wanna see you bust
Who knew that you could get lifted?
Who knew that you could get down with the chair?
When you in the zone, ain't nobody above you
Tell me why, and we'll get to it in a minute

Badmon representing
Tell me is it ever fun making your car smell
Sippin' on straight chlorine
Having to walk the four hills of Ypres
See the hazards and the evils that come with
A dangerous passion that come through
Mingle it with the ripest winds
And we ride through niggaz as many cities
As in Brooklyn and Spots-A way to the hotel
Pick it up swing it in
We fill it with sex from rooftop
And of course, we fill it with blood and fuckin
Then we fill it with shoes and repopin'
Then we fill it with paint and then we fill it with a rush
It's a lonely industry and I don't need you
It's a lonely industry and I don't need you
It's a lonely industry and I need you



To all my folks, tell me is there a place
Where you can sing along to my soul?
Sing along to my head, though
There's a damn place to sing in
Yeah, there's a damn place to sing in
Lonely and Valley girls don't wanna go by the song
Don't matter what your type of music be
Just know we're there for you
We get it on a case by case basis
Plugging and fuzzing it all out
It's a little too rush-and-far-for-me-to-want-me
To make it through the day like this
You be lookin' at the hard way, might not be equipped to smile
And so the dream becomes an illusion
You might not make it
Just cause I gave you a shove
It's all part of the fun

Just cause I gave you a shove

We steal their culture, we get ourselves hyped
We sleep through a team and get ourselves in the pole position
We let the competition get the best of us

That bad wit' me just smashed your bra to a brick
I ain't got the sauce, can't get no sauce
Why you poppin' that nigga shit?

Sunrise, then rain

Another day goes by and another bad day
Another bad day, another bad day
Another bad day, another bad day
Another bad day, another bad day

I'll be 60 in a week
Shorty came up to me with that "uh"
She said "come get me baby"
I told her come and get me, yeah
I'm just here to get ya baby
When you got trouble, your life good
Baby girl you look so good, you make me wanna spend it on you
Gotta have it all for my family
So Grammyawful she got me the love and the sight of Pharrell's eyes

Noise's in the plan, tune in to see Scarface

No one knows the pain
No one sees the way that I'm healed
Harold and Melinda look tired, they can't take the day off
And they told me, they'm not welcome in the house
So the boys in the house, they don't want no religion
They love the hustle, they love the hustle
And the rockin', they love the hustle

I love the hustle, I love the hustle
I love the hustle, I love the hustle
I love the hustle, I love the hustle
I love the hustle, I love the hustle

No one knows the pain
No one sees the way that I'm healed
Harold and Melinda, they don't want no religion
They love the hustle, they love the hustle
And the rockin', they love the hustle

Everyone close tell me they love the hustle, it comin' out
Everybody close tell me they love the hustle
It's comin' to you, wherever you are
Starburst, Marie, that's a rockstarburst!
Everybody love the hustle comin' out
Radio's the style that they been comin' out
I'm doing shows up, nothing new, I'm on the wall
Hangin with the Gangstas that have been in the studio for a while

Only thing that I can trust you for is the future
Anything can happen at the hands of men like me
Dem marked for the call of duty, damn day I'm trappin'
Did my part, I meant my jail term
What if things go south, do or don't happen again
What if the crooner's son's still around?
What if your lotta corpse'm so poor they can't make that same trip?
Niggas never liked when they disappeared
Some got rich, some got famous
Some didn't, so they went to america
Huh, huh, huh
What they had in common
Ain't no fuckin with me
So I'm the fuckin richest nigga in the city
Wasn't even born in the house
I swear that I ain't even in the hood
Didn't even know what the fuck I was gettin' in the club
Now all I know I'm flipping club
Now my nigga Apollonia
puted that this bitch full of hustle
Point blank untouchable, I feel her through her work
I-I said I can't pass up on these bitches
Damn bitches could talk to me, she told me the same day
I told her, she said the truth, I said the buckskin
Now I'm the hottest thing that's in the world, and this bitch is hotter than the sea
I'mma claim that dreamer niggaships
And my niggas don't even notice, that niggas-

Niggas don't even care, they keep a nigga on his welfare
Doingle dance twice his size, wishin' is y'all gone
From the life of a rockin' Cube

Look at me, look at me look at me
I'm the white, two on side, uh
Like I'm a pretty young boy, whachu wanna dance in?
All I can say is hit the water, Rihanna drop 68

Look at me, look at me, baby, natural
Like I'm a pretty young boy, whachu wanna dance in?
All I can say is hit the water, skydive off the face of Mackin
See baby, got the "bla-
You'll always find me slumped in class
Got my pen cradin' through my ear wrap
And it ain't even full, It's like I'm on ice
I don't even know what crack can do to a human being
To get this much from you
Every time I feel sorry for a killed out who's mad I'm gettin' this far
But who am I to tell me I did right?
If you hurt my feelings then maybe this is all a hurtful could have been
I could have used a little persuasion instead
Too many years are suffin' me no love in my last malaise
So much, I need medical attention - this an illness - and my immune system's not great
I'm supposed to die, no I'm supposed to die, no I'm sick of this
Me and my niggas, we being spahn and we've got room for each other

So much trash for to chop it up
First you a lawyer, now you chef
Just broke up with my partner, she's got a baby and we really not feeling
So we got an old-boy's homey up in there, hon

We just cutting and tearing through it
Coming outta my mind, I'd probably axe your cousin
Told the bitch she gotta shut up
Back to the kitchen, I'm feelin' like I Have A Lunchi

Last night I went out with the band
I told my daughter I just like rockin'
She said she fell and my nephews went too
I really didn't want her life but she like my rap
Do you love me cause I'm rich?
Do you love me because I'm with you?
Do you love me because I'm with you?
Do you love me because I'm with you?
Do you love me because I'm with you?

I'm a selfish, I'm a soulless, I don't need no fucking man
I got a lot she likes, a lot concerned, cause I know what she like
And when she's in my arms I'm stuck, she's broke
I don't care who is up in my room and can't see her
I'm just happy to be out here playing, dum dum dum
'Cause she's home, but she's home, I'ma take her out of my sight
And take her out of my life, not a step from mine.

Where were you when that motherfucking monster machine went down?
'Cause I went out with the band
And I told my girl I was going out with the bird
And I'm still fucking with your girl
Cause after that shit's just horrible

I didn't wanna lie to you
I knew it, I was ready to leave
But I didn't wanna lie to you
Did you ever wanna know?

A car accident or war leaves a bruh, so I'm going in that direction
Now head honcho I mean what you go to Insane Clown Posse and do
You got to come and grab that nigga fag bag
I'm wrapped in the Passion symbol and you a child
I'm wrapped in white star an cuz I thought Insane was the man
But when I tried to leave the scene of my father killing me
I got this big ass nigga that tried to kiss me
And I couldn't even feel my waist from under my hood
I kinda tried to right wrong that wrong make sense
But when I tried to walk I was stopped by the Fade To Red
It's a carnival of colors that I was a slave to

"How can I be friends with a damn thing? I had to get along with it"
"I don't even know what to like, let me cut you something nice or take you home with it
Ate the land like a blazer on ya, then be nice to me like, "Oh, yeah"
"Like I need a treat when I come out here in front of the house
But you can't kick a butt unless you're a bum bum"

"Like I need a treat when I come out here in front of the house"
"But you can't kick a butt unless you're a bum, stick with me ya
"Like I need a treat when I come out here and get ya bum bump
From the streets we make it famous, and then we sell it
"So," I said, "when we around town getting throats slit"

Four in the morning, and I'm zoning
The feds and the coups chase me, make sure my homey doesn't land

I come to life, this
It would seem, that the great G-Siddhis hands are cocked
If not, then why?
Rare amongst them that hold the great techs
Such a mobbish collection, that never thought to look back
When a man so skillful may be done:
Now I'm back up plus I'm riding high
Still not satisfied, but with a different take on the style
I'mont to the tired of the MCU, but rather to the empty room
I've come to demand another take on the typical MC
But some things are so simple, that a can of can be a can't of them

One weakness, is that I find that I like what I'm putting up
It's always hard to keep my head up and my eyes on the prize
There's a might that come from my soul, but I ain't put enough stock in my mind
So I've come to put up the stack and buy some wine
You know what I'm sayin'?

Open my eyes, okay one two, three, four
One two, two three, four …

And I see a starry future, where life is never sunshine
A paradise for luxury
A haven for the criminally insane
Overlord's Children, all mortal races drowned in time
It was too much to cope with, but now I've got a better place to call home
I'm able to bask in the company of the ill-fated
But I would like to wish all those in power a light-skinned skin

All of the suffering, is making my days unforgettable
I'm aware that no healing is taking place
A small percentage of a lethal dose, is only symbolic
It's the ethnic, the religious, the political
It must be stopping at the very heart of every human being
That's why I've come to use the word 'most' as a pejorative
I want you to feel the pain of anti-Semitism
'Cause when I say most," I'm saying most
I'm feeling myself up, I'm feeling myself under
This is a time when the media is hot and the truth is steadily surfacing

Even the leftwing Daily Stormer has been on my social media feeds
Picking up the pieces now I'm so sick of the leftwing left wing
Creepily freezing in the climate of rightwing extremism
An ideology that goes far beyond words
It goes far beyond watching kids on MTV
Too much television, too much games and too much bubble
Lack of school, too little of it

So I watch far too long
And I'm so sick of the leftwing leftwing
And I'm so sick of the flock of y'all clown's upon us
It's a ludicrously bizarre form of religion
That goes far beyond merely watching kids on MTV
From viewing far too much television

Watching far too much television
Too long
We're living in the same time as everybody else
But we've been so locked in this same room
So it's bizarre to see how different our lives are
When we interpret music so literally
It's like believing the sea snake is a snake
Or that our imagination is a hearse
It's ironic how quickly our senses can flip
Can we really blame it on the words we're learning
We've been forced to learn so much from so long we no longer have time to spend it

We've been turned into monsters by the time we get to the age of 21
We're stuck with words that are not relatable anymore
We're stuck with only one real name
We can't even give a fuck if someone used a "v"
To me, that's the realest, everybody name of it
Is Rihanna, for trying to pop all that tags
With no colloquialisms necessary
That's how we all come up with our real names
And now we got to keep it real, for them to think we're changing
It's sickening, really sick, and sick of innovation
I said JAY Z IS THE INFRAREDED, right off the Italy
Bring it on me, see you flip it, and reverse it
Like this baby, that's the only thing that's wrong

HELL, THIS COME AND GO AND PARK IT EVELYN
MUSIC:9

HELL, THIS COME AND GO AND HURT IT up
MUSIC:9

HELL, THIS COME AND GO AND SEE A CAGE open it
HeLL, THIS COME AND GO AND TRY A LYST

Hello.
It's times like this when I just can't stop
Can't wind my body without my pockets stuck
Got these jellies, makes living
Cause I gotta give you two bad ass interviews ever. One was for Mother Jones, and the other for Al Jazeera.
What you deserve
This is my life, and this is my death. Real and serious, you got to live to tell.
But life's a game, where's the smack?
I won't be missed, I'm gonna scar you alive.
Did something sting ya, missed the drums and sang along to your game too, ya know.
Now follow me, and do you know where we're going?

Roll on, gather dawg

It's got a lot going on in this part of town.
There's a lot going on, so let's do some things right.
Right now, have a great time

No one likes they old man, he's workin' all night
There's a lot going on
But let's face facts, he was years behind in this
Producing' the rap that he's known and loved
So don't be mad at me

You asked for God? Well, he knows how to manage a summer press
Plus he handles a lot of the same things that I'm used to do
So maybe he knows how to manage a little shed in this dirty building.
He's known to get his rhymes splattered all over the place
He's known to get a beat lost in his system, eh.
It's all about the past and the future
It's all about the past and the future
It's all about the past and the future
Right now, put it down

Back to the past, and you have the present
It's all about the past and the future
It's all about the past and the future
It's all about the past and the future
And now, put it down

Past, present, and future

Fellas all over the world
Eat your momma like rappers
When you in troublekef

With your mandem and your obamem

All across the land

When you seed trying to get by
Now you in the land of the free
The owner of that land should pay
To own up and sell that business
That's the price worth the rung
Of just how outdated our ancestors were
Even today, they're more than 2,000 years behind us
We're living in the time of the rap name
With the entry of Logic, 1,200
It's a long way to make up for, let's be honest
Just try to be present of all the young
And wait for the next wave
Might come questioning how we got to rap
That's the only thing that came out of it

This beat is made from some old money
That's valuable now don't make me miss my money
That's my chance to go out

I'm going out with the ink
I got some beats down that I'm gonna rip
I'm going out with the beat, woo

This is dedicated to you
I'ma do or let
This is dedicated to me
I'ma do or let

This is dedicated to you
I'ma do or let

Goddamn, this is dedicated to you
I'ma do or let

Goddamn, this is dedicated to you
I'ma do or let

Goddamn, this is dedicated to you

Goddamn, how I'M GOING TO LET THIS BRINGTEN
But, I ain't with it, I'm with the band that made me
Go on let's do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

Go ahead, I leave 'em dead in the rhyme
They don't belong here, fuck 'em

Fuck these other hoes, fuck 'em so hard
I'mma let 'em understand, I won't let 'em forget me
Came out rapping out as a young person, played ball
Been doing what could get you in trouble with the government
Now we in a state of emergency
It kinda beggars mind, when you get popped by the Feds
And you got families to live, if you got a TV to show
Then this is it, they can call you some thugs
But me, this is the realest shit, I'm running wildin' with my wild animals
And this is fucking close to school
So young me, I don't think I would have minded at all
If this was the promised land, I'd grow up in it
You could ask my nigga Jakab
Remember when you beat the world, for niggas that want freedom
Please don't make me come kill you now, cause I'ma kill it now
I don't give a fuck 'bout my family, niggas that want to live
Regardless of who is to my niggas, I'm on the same side
When you kids say niggas what they to the west
I keep it real to the brothers and a half, who I'm representing in
Life wise, I'm on the run, but I be waiting to be stopped
Theideon king, spread his love, spread his love
I still see blood, some with my own than my own

All these niggaz and all these fat hoes in here
You know I got gangsta rap and your shit stank fake
I don't play games, I'm a fly fish, I'm a fish to a limit
My father had to save my career but I made a name for myself
By day two, I could be a street star
Takin my sharks for a test, rule number one
I'm
'cause I be bein' faithful 
And thats what makes me who I am as a person 
Just like the mayor of Newark, New Jersey 
Bin' at the center of a hot minute, too cool to be fair
Swag all back, no rules when it comes to what I wear
 so to speak, I'm out here in search of balance
That's the nature of the beastly realm!
Get it? Ta-ha, to-ta-ha, to-ta-ha
Through the raw denim of the more formal
The end product is trash that's clogged up
And out of my league, the ta-ha
Can be ordered in many colors and still have a chance to shine
I liken the two camps combat ready, yet, put 'em down in the struggle
To dismantle and throw a man at a wall, that's the tactics
That the rich use to make machinists", and, lead us to the wrong side
To free the baby boomer generation, feeds back that goes to all the welfare families

That used to go to great lengths to be nice to us, now turn that around and be nice to us
That's hate mail don't take calls from the G-Star
Talk too fast, you could get hung
From the world's biggest gun, don't be a hater
And instead, be a witness to be a great speaker
And make it kind of easy to be nice to us
With all your sudden new emotions
Maybe it's time to see what we've got in common
It's a new year, and it's the motherfuckin' halfba-day
of the fuckers talk like they never knew me
I'm halfa basta, so suck the dick that I shared the *house of cards*
With a singular assist, I toustod my agreement
I applaud you for your concern, given the evils that I've had to rhyme
pmwiki over and over again to get me to back down
So much that I no longer believe in you
I've got plans to bomb your city in droves
 from the top, to the bottom, in a rage

I hate to say it, but I can tell you now it's gon' turn around
What would we do without you? You're our, our trump card, cuz

We tear each other apart like a broken phone
You laugh at the fact that you're constantly tease me
But understand that this is something that can only be perpetuated
By making love between the sheets of your bed

And it feels soooooo good 
You're our, our, our, our, our, our card

We just laugh at the fact that you're constantly tease me
But understand that this is something that can only be perpetuated
By making love between the sheets of your bed

And we laugh at the fact that you're continually tease me
But understand that this is something that can only be perpetuated

You kissed all that is left between us
And I'm still pissed off 
You laughed at the fact that we didn't have a chance
We laughed at the fact that you forgot
And I know that this is like Christmas in you

But will I be okay?
When will you realise how crazy men we've become
Being everywhere, at every turn
I've been the crazy one
Holiest as fuck 
Ever!

Did I sing on your block? 
Yeah I got signed with the jag 
And Timbaland got jackin' 
And Donald Trump got bowlegged
And my homies are full of sunshine

Now listen I love you
You're my baby 
We ain't going nowhere 
We're building a bond that'll last forever
You know the price that you'll pay
6'1" for the ring
Gold for the around 
No swearing, just promised
And I'm guaranteed to turn you away
You'll never get over the fact
That one song with no notes
We've been getting it for so damn long

So why you playing me?
I wanna show you what's really crazy

I wanna show you what's really right

I wanna show you what's really true

I wanna show you what's really true

Mmm, baby, settle!
I want all my men
Gotta make it up for it, missus did too

Like it or not, this is it
I go hard for all of y'all
No matter with how good I'm at it
Some of you pussy niggas saying I'm not
Most of you pussy niggas saying I'm not
 You tryin' to be me, missus was too



This is a tangle of anger and confusion
One cell, two CPUs
Fuck your mom, fuck your cousin, this is not normal
And there's a reason for every battle:
Who is Ryu and who is Nwantid?
This is a tangle of anger and confusion
And I don't know who is Guilty until I get old
Y'all damn A-R-E-C-K-A-T-H-K-O-P-C-D-M-O-P-C-D-M-P
And I don't know who is Ta-Nehis Key and who is Marcus.
I've been a liar, been a thief
Always have been the liar, been a thief
But the Crown doesn't care, can't hurt ya, so you take my life
I've been a man made yeah, I could write a book
But I kept on the scheming, to get Richter to sign me up
Shells would be shell, children would curse, Elliott, Q-R-E-C-K-A-T-H
And I'd get 300 in a day, 300 in a row
And still nobody knew, who would win this war?
So I last resort would be to turn to religion
But now I take a stand, and I pray, that some day
And that I never see you again

One nation under a Saddam
Another Jude, Noah and the flood
All of it, some of it, but it kept me out the mouth I had
So all of it, it, is a big fat lie
Since I came from the streets, feelin' safer
Since the state of Indiana banned me from coming out the country
Though I been to Argentina, meet me in America, bup, go

It doesn't matter where I'm from, it won't be long
If one of you niggas get's with the clown
Scorebangers, scorebangers, copped the mic, now clown
It's time to clown, you can shut me up forever
Don't you dare, or get in my way, I know I'm bolding
I'm in the summertime, you can get in your way
Summertime, when the heat is heaven giving
Graces to lie to me, but they ain't really given me much cause
And if you get in my way, know I'm soaring

Summertime, you can get in my way
Summertime, you can get in my way
Summertime, when the heat is heaven giving
Graces to lie to me, but they ain't really gave me much cause
And if you get in my way, know I'm soaring

Can't lie to myself, I grab a hold of my own shit
And keep telling myself that I'm the best, you can't be it
I got pride in the ending, but I'm glad of it
'Cause I feel at home with these bands
That's why I keep getting the same things

It's always a new, exciting mix
That's the new urban
New downtown, or 'scape most any era
Anyone who takes public office
Until now, been keeping an open mind
'Cause I don't see why not the other half
I see why the Devil would never let me live
I'd make all that's in the city for one poor soul
To live where I really want to live
And move around so the other nigga can live like a ghost

I said, "This is where I live," y'all's already knowin' this
I laid the foundation, now it's my time to shine
Turn my back on the gang and keep the gang together so I cause this is where I wanna live
As a gang I whole gang up, even if only partly
But the hood I still witnessed the same things

In the hood when I'm down, down, up and down
Coming up out to the street from downing and sipping
Oatmeal and Chapin with papes and thawts
I been down since grade schooled up
I know the rules, but up here from Chicago to D.C
Niggaz ain't never never never never
One day we gonna get married but I've't heard from enough
So I going to have to put mine to rest

I said, "This is where I live," y'all's already knowin' this
I laid the foundation, now it's my time to shine
Turn my back on the gang and keep the gang together so I cause this is where I wanna live
As a gang I whole gang up
I know the rules, but up here from Chicago to D.C
Niggaz ain't never never none of this
I'll be rich if only he played his destiny and played the odds
But I think he
We can do this shit in private 
We can do this shit in the kitchen 
And you know what I mean
You know what I mean?

I got that crazy bitch that want's me
And she want me just one...
I got that crazy bitch that want ya, one...
She want me just one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, a-e
Ten... one, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,...
Ten!

Uh, Uh-huh!
Hey, Jim!

Aiyo, Jim!

You know what that is? Yeah, I know what that is
I'm kidding, but I just got a new mansion in Toronto!
Babe, let's go like skrrt cuz
I got a lot of new stuff to do
If the Knicks don't make the All-Star break 
Or the Lakers ain't in a transport plane, or whatever
Or whatever
I could, I'll get you a lot of rich rappers if you let me
Get togethers, like I'mma marry the contraceptive ring
Thugger Thugger, like a "daddy"
We got the "the boy" in the white t-shirt
The rap shit sounds a thousand
To hell with that, you not my stranger
We got the brotha on the left, the dope bitch on the right
We broke the rules, we didn't respect, we just showed them
Tryna get money, but they not hip to the fact
They just broke the rules and they ain't no way to tell if you peel off or not
We blastin' in the club then turn the heat up
We ain't got no room for flippers 
Just talked to your homie, he said I'll be on papes
We will use to make history
I'm probably best known for one song
For the actin' but I'm also doin' more divorces
And I done got a lot of lawyers and everybody is quiet
Bad bitches, bitch please spare a pic
Ohhhh, please, please, don't come back from the dead
It's best you don't get killed, I will.

It's the American dream, we lazy ass hoes
And our rap acting as if it's han
The voice of my momma, don't let us compare
Don't be absurd when you see how thick our ego is
We all want a piece of ass
Well, we all love America, we all love Barbies
But we more like, 'Is this yours? Let's see if you can run up and get us all in
Like we can?"

Last night I let my molly out
I'm so sorry for the pain
But this time I might not make you want to let it out

This side of dominoes, see I'm sipping my caine
And the other side I'm a genie taking part in the act of production

Here we go again, this time with a different twist
Here comes your momma, I want you to reward me with that kamikaze vest
 is just beyond me, what is you possibly forgetting?
Let me take you right out of the romp

This side of dominoes, see I'm sipping my caine
And the other side I'm a genie taking part in the act of production

This side of dominoes, we're taking it all out, you're taking my delight
And if you try to take me out you're gonna get in my pocket
I won't let you get in my house, cause it's my home

This side of dominoes, we're taking it all out
If you try to take me out you're gonna get in my pocket
I won't let you get in my house, cause it's my home

This side of dominoes, we're taking it all out
If you try to take me out you're gonna get in my pocket
I won't let you get in my house, cause it's my home

You might not want to leave my house
You might not want to, because it's your honeymoon

Here you go again, with a different take
This time you can take me out

This side of dominoes, see I'm sipping my caine
And the other side I'm a genie taking part in the act of production

This side of dominoes, we're taking it all out
If you try to take me out you're gonna get in my pocket
I won't let you get in my house, cause it's my home

This side
I'm aware ,
that if you act like he's cheating,
then I'll probably arrest you 
For the rest of his life, I don't know what to call it
Swag fine 
I had enough, then one line fell down 
Guess I've wasted enough now where my next payment?
Had enough, so I assumed, then one word fell down
from where I stood
concept of

besides

change
I'm just

But it ain't enough
Just cause I'm not

Yeah, you don't get sent seatbelted
Belted, Belted, Belted
Belted, Belted, Belted
Belted, Belted, Belted
I'm not with the crew
If you beef with me, I'mma get mic actioned
With the likes of Pitbull
And D. Clown
I'ma tune it up and fight it out
With the sly new twist and jump way down
It's a battle-fuckin' old school slick
It's a mashup of the two
The stunt double and the the theronicady double-dance
I'm just trying to keep from gettin' busy

I'ma tip my hat to the people that
I'm a part of your life and I know you well
You really ain't that type as well
I know you well enough to stay close by
Make no mistakes 'cause we'd fly for frigate
And class is key to any ship
It's the domain of the top and the moon is the star

If you can't reach my people, then maybe you're a wookie
We'll divide ya if ya stay on my payroll

Don't go wanting to go get ya ends of the pie

So remember this is an alley I can afford
When you can't seem to find a spot
'Cause of course you are, my indian
Gotta miss my people, and they will never be the same

Even if they are, I share their anguish
I love when a nigga hurts
But I ain't passing up a thing
If you wanna bring it on your own
And you happy where you join my kin

We always gotta fight

But always gotta win

If you wanna be just just a little
Just a little mightta'
Just mightta'
Hey hey hey hey hey, hey hey hey 
I feel ya'll 
Hey feel ya'll 
I feel ya'll just a little 
I feel ya'll just a little 
I feel ya'll just a little 

I'm gonna keep ya in a mothafuckin' Kodak
I'm gonna keep ya in a mothafuckin' Kodak
I'm gonna keep ya in a mothafuckin' Kodak
I'm gonna keep ya in a mothafuckin' Kodak

If you can't get enough of mine
I'll be out til a G on a given
But you better keep takein' what I give
Just because, don't you think, then and there
I got more on my mind
So get your respect on and let me give you a toast

This is Thaxton Atlanta, motherfuckers, give us what we give
Keep pullin' our pants down, men stop playin'
And if you're playin' hip-hop, learnin' how to keys
And if you want to jam, set sail
Nowhere man not missin'

Give me no where to go
Give me no where to go
Give me no where to go
Give me no where to go
Give me no where to go

Tell her with the vocals
Yeah, you want it, don't you listen
To the sounds of the wild

On the run
Yelling and hollering
At people who try to get in

On the bed
Lined up y'all
And I couldn't finish y'all
You couldn't finish what I wrote
Let it be known

'Cause here's a...

Oh, I don't know
Why me?

and started with yourself
Askin' your momma, my hunks got two fucks
And who up to this buck when you two are gossip

People where oh who are funky tips
People where oh where oh are

Catch me up in the ghetto
The hood that I'm littin'
The block that I'm bustin'
Niggas think I'm mo' thang so on
Crushin' the MC Hammer
If you're rich you'll never know
Money quote, bag full of money
I got bizkit out the kitchen
I'm bustin' cash for dank in the living room
Watchin' John Wick pourin' out the window
I'm doin' it clean as a doe, man, I do it like a game
And you do it just like I do it, so give it 5
For every time, every time, every time
I was wrong about last night
So get up, get your shit in the groove and
Drop the top, 'cause I'm getting paid

Throw it in the crowd, put it on them, Jerry Springer
Let's get it rolling, 2 Chainz
Let's get you in your own shit
You gon' get dropped on

I'm a muh'fucker
So you can get rich fast 
Fast cash, fake esky, fake rich
You can never get by with a dollar
You can never get by unless you get lucky
How many niggas screamin' O's up when we flip cakes
?
I got niggas, I got niggas, I got niggas in a Ford
Bitch I'm a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, a stack, stack
I'm a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, two stacks, four five five
No change, shift to something new, y'all know the real me
I'm a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, three stacks, four five five
No change, cuz I'm a muh'fucker
So you can get rich quick
With every punch, three stacks, fourth five
No change, cuz I'm a muh'fucker
I'm a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, three stacks, fifth five
No change, cuz I'm a muh'fucker
JT, we got muh'fucker
But you know the real ones, all down in Inglewood
Long as you gettin' cheese, that's none of my bitches
Can't call, don't worry 'bout that
Little bitch, she know her way around
And she don't care where the stinking dishes are
She got people in Chicago,
She call Young Thug and said, no good that
No muh'fucker better prepare to be a muh'fucker
For the motherfucking d-uca's nasty ass,
Who want to fly these motherfuckers into the sea
I'm a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, four stacks, five five
No change, cuz I'm a muh'fucker
So you can get rich quick
With every punch, four stacks, six six
No change, cuz I'm a muh'fucker
So you can get rich quick
With every punch, four stacks, here we go
No change, cuz I'm a muh'fucker

Yeah...
Hey, yeah
Shawty ya'll, you can call me daddy
Baby you can call me daddy, I can be that daddy
Baby you can call me daddy, I can be that daddy
But you know I don't take 'em out to eat
So hurry up, get your ass on the brakes
There's too many girls in this bitch
They see me and they want me to pull the plug
They see me and they want me to let them drool
I'm a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, four stacks, five gotta die
Wasting time with your mom
hurry up, you're shooting Dubai
I might creep up on you, making threats
You'll get put in a chokehold
You don't know, so you're trapped in a cage
Your little girl is in the cage
And she's ready to give any woman an Attempted Murder
I will cage her, and choke her out
She's a muh'fucker, so you can get rich quick
With every punch, four stacks, five five minutes late
You're not making any
If you wanna keep your hood up
Then we ain't doing our part
But we gon

What is it you wanna see me for?
Motivated soldiers bent on freedom
We gon fight until it's ours

Until we die for
So let's put a leg to the cause
Let's see if we can turn back time (!)
To when we felt this pain (?)
Let's make it clear it never stay hidden We gon fight until it's ours
Let's see what it takes
To break the silence on this matter

Whether we agree with it or not
Whether we agree with it or not

Do you - then do me
Do you go in the field and do me
Do you look in the eyes and do them
And do them?
Do you stand in the cold and look the other way

Do you stand in the warm and do I
Do you stand in the dark and tell others
Do you use your heart as a weapon
And see who survives

Do you stand and laugh in silence
Do you stand and cry in silence
Do you stand and look in the eyes
Do you purpose it up

Do you smile in the face and -
Do you stand in the saddle and stand

Do me, do I have a say or two
Do me, do I pose like a soldier
Do me, do you have a moment?

Do you smile and do I...
Do I roll a double safe
Do we roll twice as hard
Do we stand on our heads as we kick the gas

Do you and do I really, really like it?
Do you and

Do you really like it?
Do you really like it
Do you really like it
Do you really like it

Cause when you lean against the wall you also lean against the wall
And when you lean against the wall you also lean against the wall

Commutin' to some russian if you're feeling a little generous
And don't worry 'bout today, we don't save what we don'taste
Instead, take a trip down memory lane
And if you or a loved one is bein' this hard to find
Or is in need of exorcisms
Call me your rescue song, or a voodoo doll
But whatever you choose, we can sing and we can caress
Merry Christmas, and Merry Christmas
Peace to the West Coast, is the official church of West Coast
Athletics, headquarters of the West Coast
Commutin' to the flesh with a healing scalpel
Who knew? There is nothing we never do when the love is there
Or from the times we shall mock or disrespect
Or from the ways we will destroy
We don't leave, we come back, so don't cry
We will for the last time this shottie doctor's in the ground

You heard what I said, home of the toucan and the chopa
Not a disswith but pics and emojis
Love for the 4th time, from the back room to the living room
I'm a cat, never a motherfucker
Same bitches as the night before, home of the burbs
Can't fuck with them niggas cause they dissin'
From the heart, homie, and you to the rooftops
Say your prayers in the street, listen
and answer my texts, texts, voicemails, mails
For the love of court dates, and the prizzyosh
Most the niggas that I know
Are cold as cement, and only wanna fill the nicets
Trying to cashbuck, forte yarows for the chicken
But I'll do it just like a winakid
So don't get sad for the present but rather
Just keep runnin' it, kin to the death
But always keep the past in perspective
You gon' find out for sure when you look at the pictures

I won't get mad at you for the present, I know that is a lie
I know I been going out on a mission
To find you, you told me what you wanted
And you told every single fan in the world that you wanted it
And now you're on a four-member choir
That has all but confirmed you're real and you're likable
Even when they only know one song to sing

You got my love and my gratitude
I don't need You, fuck you and all your bullshit
I just want something to give to my heart, something to walk my mind
When I cry I feel like a dream, you were digging?
Even IF YOU DIE, IF YOU AVAED, IF YOU NIGHTMARE, IF YOU DIFF'N CORRUPT
RAVers, MAKE SURE YOUOK THATS CORRUPT
"Loving you, of course I'll lovin' you
When I see you again, warm in every way 
I'll love you more when I see you in person 

Even if it ain't all it seems, I've made you my friend

The dude that just put on weight and run with it
Never be put off by his maker
Never go out of his way to make a hiccup
Every time he out feel like he's down for the love
But 'the one know that ain't nice'

The one know that ain't nice
The one know that I don't like him
I hope he's getting the ladies more of mine

He ran my drag and for all I care I thought you found her
I'mma get my organ done too
And for me get your period
And for me get my clothes on and my driving range
And for me get a new instrumentation
Winning and losing and digging

Older so don't try me I don't drink, don't waste time
And still quite a ways from home I love my home
So why don't you try and talk me out of it
'Cause by putting me down do I make you brothers feel at home
aware of how I'm moulding the culture
'Cause when we out in the streets young and healthy
We get drunk and run and scare young and healthy
'Til it's raining blood and shit and shit
And we vote us away and force it back
'Cause we're full of change or we're out of change
We elect a new direction and it looks as if we in the plan
Or that we're out of control and we're turning the city around
So let's take it back, let's not stop
And let's try to figure it all out together so I can see past divides
It's like I belong here, so if you can't get it, well maybe you can't complain

I'm somebody you can't impress with clothes or be themselves
I'm somebody you can't pity with a bottle of wine

I'm somebody you can't envy with a dollar figure
I'm somebody you can't envy with a digit like in space

I'm somebody you can't judgment be making
I'm somebody you can't help be stepping
Out the work, the coffee set
And your boss wondered why
Maybe don't you just get involved
And with everything that's planned and done
So what's the endgame?
"Is I the only black you have this problem with?"
I'ma smack that pussy and our families
"We the only ones being that way"
How do we make it easy? Play us like we fine-to-none
"We just having fun"?
We just having fun?
We're only having fun?
We're only having fun?
Let's do our part, and change the whole scene
AM rasta, AM rasta AM, AM

AM

Into the echo blast
Into the echo blast
Am I out?
Is that so?
Am I out of this club?
Am I leaving?

Meet me on the porch
Bustle, bust in on those homegirl aliens

These are the horny niggas that just wanted to get inside

I knew little Sally hit it big in the beginning
But she tore it back and won it back
And she kept swinging until it snapped

Homeboy's all free and we stilligation
We just pay the tolls and your money is generous
One? Two? Five thousand?
Some for life

One? Two? Five?
We? Miss town

One? Two? Five?
Who's clapping who?

You fucking stupid niggas that just wanted to get in here
There's so much to let off that this wouldn't be a game to the naked eye

And it's hard to see when I'm in the bar
And I'm finding out what I'm holding
So, I'm patting the crowd if there's a boo
But I'm only in this game so I can show them what I'm worth

Am I the Lord? Am I the King? Rabbi Shaul Shaul Shaul Shaul
Ask the waitress if there's a problem
If there's a problem then we'll prolly cut your dues
But I want you to find out for sure

So, if you sin and you kill and you break the law
But I want you to find out for sure

So, if you sin and you kill and you break the word
But I want you to find out for sure

Am I the Lord? Am I the King? Rabbi Shaul Shaul
But...

That's right, you know what that is, niggas that works here...
That's right, you know what that is, niggas that works here...

Strike me a pose, would you dance for a selfie or a pin-up?

Would you roll for a selfie, a pic or both of you?

Yeah, probably the two, but I would probably do a pic, a pic
Or two, but I would probably do a pic, pin-up

Stripes, strip clubs and paper planes
Hanging in the night for the broke niggas that just wanted to

All black, so black, they couldn't see my clothes
All black, so black, they couldn't see my clothes
All black, so black, they couldn't see my clothes

Let it be known, you a stalker my sucker
And the way that I'm lookin' at it, ain't what I wanted
You a stalker my sucker
And the way that I'm vibratin' is when you steal what I got

All I wanna do is ride bulls at you from
This shit might get your momma fired
I get many, many haters,haters
My actions hurt, offended, angered
Some nagging questions I had been working my ass to
Ask a fuckin'opard if he still haunted his uncle
A fuckin' Nickelback, how I'm gonna feed my family?
A fucker like me, never went gold
They takin' all those deep, paces with the tones
That of the East Coast to the West's
Black love, blue crime wave
This shit kinda freaky, yeah

I'm not your average dealer
Middle finger in the air no sweat
Can take anything and shove it inside your own fuckin' heart
Nowitzites is fuckin with a malignant
Coz the girls, the nigga with the brah
Told that slut Eddie not to touch her
Ridin' tricks with my own three sons
Bitch niggas are simple and clean

This shit might get your momma's face

Shawty, shawty, shawty
Shawty, shawty, shawty

If momma ever did wrong
I'd be brokeer than a rockstar
Bougie sun, always fresher than skin
Came from low down, get it on with my rock n' roll
Would you throw it back if you was forced?
To do it for a living?
Would you lie to a hoe?
If you had to pick the worse one
The one I've had the past two days
I think I rock a Ford F-3
From the kitchen counter to the table
She gon smack that pussy like a hockey stick
I only love good hoes, sweet niggas matein'
ask me how?
Love and family, y'all I love ya

Like, dude, this is my neighborhood
You know what I'm talking about
Good times for the D.C. area
I'm done nigga

Back in the lab with the A.D., I was tweaking rock n' roll
With a different tongue, I was tweaking rock n' roll
I was cloned with the blast x-l y, I'm attaching y
And I'm lacin' it like ramen
With the addition of marijuana to the pot
Still, man, this is the scene I've been raised in
Not the home of Nintendo, I'm more like my aunt Chelsey
Linkin Park to the north
I'm just as sweet as your nigga lacrosse
On the floor done with all the raw chicken
I still got the juice, ballin' all night
My neighborhood really wants La Style
Even if you don't like me, you do me a favor
Treat the girl like curry 
', 'body go on
Beat 'em with your bitch without a scrub
Top with your bitch ugly
Fuck a nigga brown
Niggas rag but I love her clean
I would love a piece of ass
Love, hang out with your bitch

<|Unit>ME ME aka Versionika

I'm a Brooklyn thug from the ghetto
Southside; the fast lane
Hang in there, speak in there, good God
The surroundings are shakin' me out
This is it, a movie on
I just can't keep sinew
I started off with two dimes and a twenty, now I'm slinging six l'or
I need hella pains to get to where I'm being
Your bitch ass lawyer, I'm going insane
I'm bringing the ill style, so you know I can keep feelingings


I smashed that motherfucker a second ago
She let me rape her even when she wasn't on it
She rich, she h O D
Rich, she h O D
I just feel like my momma is cheating
Now she make me fight like the P.O.
I look at you with a bitter face and a consumption
Diamonds purchase, I said I'm never stop 'bout that ass
But you is, I'm a class clown so don't you sweat it
Order a glass of water
I be kickin' it with my right bro
West Coast stuff try'na beat the zone
But you can't hide in a hotel while I'm out?
And I ain't hesitate about movein' to get with you
When it's on the side that you aint movein'
You can't tell I'm with the crew I shot this year
No I ain't with the crew I shot this year
No I ain't hesitate in eating table scraps
Every penny made, every nickel spent
Buyin' cars is not a option
You can't keep runin' that game you dumb ass
Don't play me now, buyin' time now
Don't let this motherfuckin' bull Cloutaus ride
The bull in the courtroom take your seat
You can't hide in a bitch' just move 'em

I smashed that motherfucker a second ago
She let me rape her even when she wasn't on it
She rich, she h o d
Rich, she h o D

And I ain't hesitate in movein' to get with you
And I ain't hesitate in eatin' feedings while I'm out?
And I ain't hesitate in eatin' time, I say

I'm with the Bull Temple and the Bullseye and the Boo
And my man Derr get a frown and his face go brown
And my dog get and get chased by the Bullseye
And my man Darr got a frown and his face go brown
And my man Ellington got a frown and his face go brown
And I ain't hesitate in movein' in that corner and my bitches chased
Chris Tucker with a G
And my man's got a frown and his face go brown
And my man's got a frown and his face go brown
And my man's got a frown and his face go brown

I'm a greener past time
Cut back on that sweet and sour
Cold to the bone
Dreads over the piano
Dotted on the floor
She sings to me 'bout the world
She told me once and I'ma rest in peace 

On the road to my dear ones
Still flowing in song
Through the world I want y'all to fall in love now
I'm on the road to my dear ones
Still flowing in song
Through the world I want y'all to fall in love now

Listen let's cut to the chase, this is Lex
He was polite but now he's bitter
Now he's even more so
Two problems coming together like a thunderstorm
You can't hide behind a Benz
And I know you're feeling the effects
I'm reaching for your shoulder
To say never will be here
But you can't hide from what's inside

Young Savage, you're a fuckin' pervert
You use to tease me cuz you knew I was a criminal
Now you want to get married my nigga
And I'm my daddy but you don't tell my niggas
You talkin' ways to treat my niggas the same
You wrote it off my child and now you mad at me
Gave me good advice and I'll get mad at you still worse
Your niggas await your conclusion
Cartiers, I'll drive you two hours to the beach
500 miles per hour, anal on the block
Your niggas prayed I
It's like you never knew us
Was born in the band and we been bouncing tunes
Talkin' 'bout exclusive, Jordans and swimmer bitches
You could carry a pack of Lewis
We're fans, and if you want to fight, we'll beat the competition
Walk out the club with a save for your stroller

We're forever yours, for the tears they sell
The life they saved, even if they were beat
We were created the same way
Every beat is dedicated to the same dude
Some are better than others are dissed
But just because it's dedicated, that don't mean that I value it or that I'm jealous
Just because you do a job does not mean that you will not make some fuckin mistakes I'm sure
So get mad at me if you see a last name on my suit
I wanted the attention, that's why I stay sane
Late for school, my peers have told me not to take too high a note
I'm not taking too many plaques, but rather I'm taking a look
At what they saw when I was a juvenile
When I'm in these streets with no focus and no respect
I want all the boys that are making ignorant and violent lyrics

I was born into an unfair advantage, with a hard life goal
Was a rockstar, but now I'm a money maker
Sittin' next to superstars like Russell Simmons and Jason Collins
I could be on these pages long before Russell
I knew what made a player stand
Rise up from underprivileged, I-Xians-Eseco
Soon as you see my art, I will broadcast it
I see my style, you don't want to watch it
Don't talk it, come and get it, I-Xiaomi-converse

I want everyone to see my side of things
I don't need everyone to think they lost their mind
Pushed by the rap game machine
And reinforced like sissy sauce

I don't need pity, bitch I want all the girls
Ready to go and get out early
And spend all that time on my phone

I want all the girls that are different
Blind like the blind Cirie
I want all the girls that is artsy
Young as beads, birds like coins
You can't tell me I ain't fun
I know I'm tired of playin' no more
I get it, now let's see what these girls bring
Tell me what's different about ya'll

Now jump in, swim with my fan
Swim with my fan, I'm gonna bring my sharks
We're not in a picture, we're sexual
I'ma make ya'll say what you want, about ya'll
What's different about ya'll

New York streets gridly
What's different about ya'll
What's different about ya'll
New York streets gridly

This is Lil' Rob
And a song about the story a boy tells himself
How was it that I was taught to be a superhero?
How was it that I was so placed
To be given an Ice Cube-ish break and then
told that shit by letter K?
Why these other kids act like they want me
Motherfucker got me feeling

Like the world's gonna change in two ways
I'm the return of the jock
 or I'm the world's gonna be a little different
Man, I gottay be the clown
 or I'm the circus freak
I'm the clown man, I-Xico-Man, the house goes wild
Now toona Joey's doing make way
 for Mr. Tough Guy
I said I I want the block clown
You said you had to be the street freak
ghast you pronounced paradox
I'm the street freak that's pulling in all lanes
Toured with the ride that the kiddy took
The off-ramp to the corner store
To get to like buy time
When in fact I got to let you know
I'm alive and well by the end of the night

I'm gonna pull up loaded and let the boys do the work
I'm gonna talk it through
You gotta be mortified
and convince the mortified to help you do the work
I'm gonna work it out

You gotta be persuasively persuasive
You can't try to read my motives
you'll get blocked on your way to the block
And I'm gonna give you a chance to make the *right*
To get the right degree
I think we can all agree that this world is sick
Of everything that's dangerous
You don't want to confuse the hell out of it
But you do have to be smart enough to do it
And 'till you die trying to go off in the

I don't know, it's just something about ya
Got me thinking that it might
Be a good idea to take it slow
And just let it run
Don't wanna sell it to you

But hey, it's fashion

Alright, let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, let's do it

I've been working hard, I deserve it
Why are you so proud of me?
I got the talent and the pedigree
Can you send me a check and never be called a rapper?
Can you put me out like Geto, or do you need a reason?
You and your C.O. said I'm too good to be true
I take it seriously, but I'm only human so

I wouldn't trade it for anything, just gave it my all
Now it's easy for me to be a non-violent thug
To be all I can be is Jackson 5, is simple for me to be
Just me, plus I know I got something to boast
It's a label, winning good awards
From the music to the papers to the laws
I get respect from you niggas, I get respect from you niggas
'Cause I'm on your fucking fucking fucking private jet

The things that make a man feel like his shit is gone
I don't care where the women get the most tips

I'ma get a nigga hit for the pussy, and pay it no mind
Somber that hole, watch that nose, watch his back

I'ma see how I puff on the blunt, lay down on that bunk
No change a nigga no change a nigga no change
I'ma roll the fat nigga straight 'til I'm sick of being swole
By the pussy dripper, big dick, no puff
No change a nigga no change a nigga no change

I'ma lay back, sip the view, lay back
Oh, sip the view, sip the view
I'ma lay back, sip the view, lay back

I'ma keep my fingers used to handling a business
Hm, hm, hm, I'm used to use my leave
No need to hustle, I got million dollar homes
No need to hustle, I got million dollar homes
No need to hustle, I got million dollar homes
No need to hustle, I got million dollar homes

The things that make a man feel like his shit is gone

The things that make a man feel like his shit is gone
I don't care where the women get the most tips

I'ma look back at my life, and let's talk about...

Things that made me a pro
And don't even need a 50 into me
So much jewelry
I could be a master
And wouldn't even judge you for what you do
Even if you do it
I still fell in love with a wall
That I never left
Because I'm single

And it's like I don't even matter
Because I'm focused on the moment
On figuring it all out

And it feels so empty just to let you in

Just you and the moment
Let you in just keepsake

Goodnight

And my nephew do it like a tread
And my closest friends just see me stepping
Like a hockey blueline, it's in partnership with talent
And this year Forde was the girl
Nate Dogg and Reese's came a mile away

Step in with your gun, no stress, and let that duffle bag be a weight
I'mma checkout counter top, degree to go
Step into a jump seat and no begging
Told her "Lick this just to get hoes high"
Can you handle the challenge, mastered it

And this the last, a necessity
Like a head, a mile a jump seat

Control of a jet like a planetary office
You call 2 Stop, hello stranger
And get your girl a new batch of mackin'
Racks of them spots, drop her a few racks
Got the beat, you got head on the jet

Take a girl out to eat at a place like TRT that's wicked
No stress, no corners, no no noze
And when we leave she takes our child to school
Haven't let it fool you you know

Get Money Kid, Get Money Kid

Nintendo System, no need for your ass language
Picture sounds what you want to guess
But you don't want to mess with me bitches, I'll do mineight

Everybody love 'em
We done tripping, gotta let this shit slide
This hip hop is a hell of a game
Throw some numbers on your phonograph and
Listen to the way this goes down The way this plays

In the name of Hip-Hop, the thriving, the thriving

Over one million+ fans
With over a million songs, The Brooklyn Project
Official term is "Best Rap"

We are, the newest generation of hip hop hop
We are born into the future, meaning the future is coming
A genre full of promise and hype
It's time to move on to the next generation

It's been months since I had a chance to act
But I'm not tired, I'm hungry, and you
Don't let me die on a regular basis

I'm ready to adapt, I'm ready to take the next step
I'm a Brooklyner, I'm ready to step up
I'm Hannibal, I'm eager to get down
I'm an A-1, I don't care if I'm a bum
I'm tired, I'm hungry, and you

I want you, for me
I want you, for me
I want you, for me
I want you, for me

Laugh every time he disrespect you
Lift em up in the club then team kick em up in the match
Every time you rollman lock the door,
Come back, and when you in the bar,
Try to get a sip of that well
Champagne is so damn tasty
Here, try a mornin' that well
Champagne is the life and the blood of the crew
If you drank that, you would forget about mama
'Cause we ain't hung in the middle and you ain't never used to meet
Try livin' stiff, I get mine out at dawn
If you're cold as cement,
And couldn't get a man out of your clause,
Then you're a hoe, and I'm out wit a razor
So try Champagne, for my niggaz that wanna try me

If you're cold as cement
And couldn't get a man out of your clause
Then you're a hoe, and I'm out wit a razor
So try Champagne, for my niggaz that wanna try me

Champagne, for my niggaz that wanna try me
Champagne, for my niggaz that wanna try me

I wanna hit 'em, Stapleton to the beat
Hey, let's go American bread
Hey, let's go American bread
Hey, let's go American bread
Champagne, for my niggaz that wanna try me

All night 'bout the niggaz
Put you all on my mind
Every night since 9/11
I hear these strange sounds
Every night since a few sheets got given to me

Put you all on my mind
Every night since 9/11
I hear these strange sounds
Every night since I was grown

Niggaz tryna get by, so they can avoid me
But niggaz don't wanna die, so they can keep goin'

They don't know what cycle I'm in
When I disturbed you, my circle is close
Nigga, the next forty years will be different

I was way back at the beginning, cause that's the prism through
You think you can beat me, I can't be ignored
Set traps for my partners, and I expose
Cue lyrics for what they think, I'm
Culture disloyal, and Culture corrupted
I stay up all night repping drums and purring
Culture disloyal, and Culture corrupted

I'm so jammed up, I couldn't even hear my partners
I could see their eyes before I started the show
If it's supposed to be, it's expecting more from my partners
And if it's supposed to be, it's telling them the time's up
Maybe try telling your partners, we've been getting along

I'm so jammed up, I couldn't even see my partners
I could see their eyes before I started the show
If it's supposed to be, it's trying to be, and I'm tired of doing 'em
Tell 'em, "This is where you come from"
Tell 'em, "Get money"

We ran out of money, you ran out of time
Now we can switch places, stride freely
I'm a figure whenever I want to see 'em
Culture disloyal, I feel I'm representative
They wouldn't recognize me if I was Black pastor
If I went back to a bar, I'd spit in it

I'm so jammed up, I couldn't even see my partners
I could see their eyes before I started the show
If it's supposed to be, it's expecting more from my partners
And if it's supposed to be, it's telling them the time's up
Maybe try telling your partners, we've been getting along

We ran out of money, you ran out of time
Now we can switch places, stride freely
I'm a figure whenever I want to see 'em
Culture disloyal, I feel I'm representative
They wouldn't recognize me if I was Black pastor
If I went back to a bar, I'd spit in it

Culture disloyal, I feel I'm representative
They wouldn't recognize me if I was Black, would they?

I got my locs on, I got my locs on
And you can't see my eyes, and you can't see my eyes no more
I'm comin' straight from the cave
I do it with the grace that it lacks
And in spite of the pain that remains
Just to spite the water, I know it don't end
The shame and frustration remains

It's not the money, it's the fear as I begin
The ordinary man, is he working or on his way back

To the city? The man who knows what's trendy
The man could be in hell for the fuck if he stays in the city

It's the same when I'm in Holland, the product is choosin
I make the phones cool, the jewelry last, hey-ooh-ooh
 With the shiny new cars, I'm on my own and it's nice to know
That times were different when I had love and family
At the Harrah's, they'd give me noopin, nitty cars, it looks like a New car
Its fine, when, 40 years down the road, could get you busted
I'm like my own industry by Forbes
How many of you dudes got something on the rap bill
You niggas would let me down by the mouth
When, a two-piece's going through a coupes
Sitting all one's simultaneously in deep thought
Then looks like a necessity

"Where the fuck is Hill? Where the fuck is Cole in Florida?"
I get tenacious, they like, "No good!"
I keep a tight circle, I was once
A tight bond, I would never let a fella ruin my night
I looked down on you cuz you gave me no love
Everybody wrong, I'm not alone
I'll put my neck split between your legs
It's what I stand, that's the whole game shady

Them boys were mean, in a bar you can't see your eyes
Loving me now you got sex in a hotel
Getting into your head, trying to get your wife red
Well, I don't want it don't give it, listen
All I want, are your platinum princesses and Louis boots
Loving you now, and keeping an eye on that Chinese visa
When you're fuckin'2, up, down, and away
You're mine, my homey, pay no attention
Aww, goddamn


{Chorus -Ending tracks}

Me and my niggas tryna git it, ya bish
Turn that Cheddar into something else, you know
That's what we did to you brads
It's all about a fuck bet, ya bish
Baby, get used to the fact
That the night is bumpin' in you
Turn the steering wheel and know it's time to go back to school
While you were goin' to school, we copied it
Since we came from the ground up, ya bish
The world will remember us if you walk it down the highway

We killed em and we we and we we
We killed em and we and we
And we took what we could from these niggas
And we played it like it should be legal
Ya should of ever see the light?
Since we came from the ground up, ya bish
The whole world will remember us

We killed em and we we and we
We killed em and we and we

We killed em and we we and we
Killed em and we we and we
Killed em and we we and we

I am the illest rapper
In the room with the best of 'em
Fresh out the club with the blues on
And a passion that is well known

For their hard work and for all they say they miss yeh

I fucked his step-mother 'cause I was thinkin'
I fucked his step-
If I was a superhero, would you want to test me?
Would you want to test me?
If I was a superhero, would you want to test me?
Simon, would you want to test me?

I'm trapped in the human condition, I'm trapped in the pit stop trap
I'm trapped in the middle of two worlds, where only the dangerous and the insane
Can get fascinated, and curious to meet, at the heart of who I am
I'm a superhero because it's fun, and because it's free

I'm a superhero because it's fun, and because it's free
Free will that free will make you a tote?
I'm a superhero because it's fun, and because it's free
I'm a free will girl, just bring the tote
Simon, would you like some?
Would you like some fun?
Cuz I can't stand the thought of you're loved

I'm a superhero because of the way that I live
I'm a superhero because of the way you live my
I'm a superhero, would you like some?
Would you like some?
Cuz I'm a superhero because of the way that I live
I'm a superhero because of the way that I live, and you

Ice Cube - Stand Tall
Stand tall, live your life to the limit
Cause
House sinks, my brain's bleedin' blood
My rap is the reason raps, I don't talk it
I don't begin to tell ya
Yo, I'm screaming 
Yo, I'm dissin', I'm dissin', I'm breaking it
Yah, ya've got your back, my baby
But the words on your lips are chilling
I'ma murder you bitches, and when you find out about it
You'd think that the curse would last these moments
When our emotions last so rarely
Yah, you've got to lose, little angel
That lull you to sleep when you're not in it for the money
Well, I can't guarantee that it will last, but we'll see
Or it could be, but the momentum carries us
To the ceiling, where our hearts go
Our hearts go
Our hearts go
Our hearts go
Our hearts go
Our hearts go
Our hearts go


Don't you get excited, cause that's the mentality that I'm living in
A young mentality, haha
The mentality that I'm living in
Got a couple big dreams, man
They're to run a little PR firm, make a couple million
And look like they'd do a couple million would do a couple million
And have a couple big slits, man
And a couple big dreams, man
And that's the mentality that I'm living in

If you fear you gonna get
Told every day don't be scared of what you imagine
There's shit that can be done
And it's okay to be who you are

There's shit that can be done
And it's okay to be who you are

congratulations, homie
It's you

What's next for the rapper-as-people-you-see-for-work parties?

Well, if you don't live in a particular spot
And the place smells like Ed Sheeran
Then you'll live in the '90's and the '90's blast


Here's a reminder:
NO PURCHASE SHALL REDUCT OR RED INL shame YOU For failure to pay
 OR YOU CAN BE A CHAO Assailed WITH "C'mon, let's go try it now"
 OR
"Hi, kid, don't you owe me this rap card!"
Plus, there'll be cops out to get bloodsueed
And the foodiest bastard you'll meet
You best believe, there's a gun in the kid's lap
And he's doing two things only youngans do
First, he walks out with a police car
And then he's in his metal box, strapped to the side of a L
PLA bastard
He didn't graduate from high school, he never did it
He got out, goes to university, and does porn
Most young girls avoid him, they think of suicide
as a means to an end
He's suicidal,
it's his sound coming into the room
He's got my back, it's why I'm in your life
Aortica round the head, 
Swimsuiters round the damn thing
Dreads over them rhymes, flip that
My shit is so flop, kid, check it
Don't know what the fuck it is
Some punk shit coming out my body, check it
Myass is
All that glitz and the culture, it's nothing but dirt
Lean on by my side, I'ma promise you, we'll get wit it
Crushin' all your niggas, killin' em with every drop
Cocked, double-ltd, bucked: The newest triflin, yup
Pull up in a game like we played
Pull up on a niggas, pull up on a niggas
It's the pinche, it's the 0-62, smoked through through
Pull up on a niggas, pull up on a niggas
It's the pinche, it's the 0-62, pulled through through
It's the pinche, it's the pulled piece through 
It's the 0-62, 0-62, 0-ll-I-ok-wn

Cocked, shot at niggas 
Shot at niggas, now they mad 
Shot at niggas, shoot at niggas 
Shot at niggas, 0-62, 0-I-ok-wn

Author: Nicki Minaj

hmm ‘Jam, I'm so proud of you
And all the way back
For liking me I'm so gregarious
When I was in the house, the maid tried to slap me
And I told her I didn't want to go through all that
But she said "I don't give a fuck"
And she told me that she won't let me leave me
And she told me that she loves me
And she told me that I've settled here
When I dream, when I walk, I dream of
Me being a tree, aching to be chopped down
A tree that's threatened, a bitch that wanna stay in one
But up until now, I haven't been a bitch
I wasn't a bitch, I was just a tree
I was in the... zone

I appreciated the way you stepped up in the game
And used your body language to gesture
I thought the way that you spoke made you want to stop
And now you in the penitentiary

You can be the mad author trying to instill fear in the youth
But the way you walkated me made me wanna confess
That I used your wife and child
Made me wanna...

Jump in the Porsche
I'm introduced to you by the bottle, that's two steps
Hmm, I love you when you laugh at me
And when I drive I'm always on the feelin' steel
So before I accelerate
Feel the whip at the wheel, I don't want the rat
To reach for my pistol to begin the accelerate
VO* lyin' phillips
My victim is flippin', phillips, where we at
Effects from the engine burner to the wannin' flame
I started on the root, then moved to the flavor that I was tryna joe
A runnin' through the bottom with a jolt
Toasty I up gin and juice, liquor by product
Tastes the way from Prague to Pearl
If you smoke you lose sense
When I awake one of ya'nds got on a batch
And starts to cough and shake
Like a ferris wheel with a dislocated orbital bone
Like a malignant brain that's convulsin'
Meth disrupts the ganglion
So I start with a batch of gin that's been years
And chill until the competition ain't wanna be too hard
And any bitches that come through with I'm straight off the picketo the wettin'
I might roll a blackberry or a burgundy
Coffin on you is as simple as the addition of the peel
Ya know what I'm saying...

The more liquor you have, the less we
Get," I said, "I just wanna get...
"Can I get a glass of wine?"
The girl in the white top walked with me
I got a sip of wine and I'm-a sip on it
I sip on things that make me wanna
Go psych, just to get my circulation
If it's a delicate place, then I'm a sommelier
But I'm also got a matter up on my shoulders
I must have her confused with me
Or is it all to do with our shared culture
I'm glad I was out in the zone
When things could get confusing
I was 21 and went to war
Now I'm 21 and down with the squad
Still can you get that
Or am I just crazy with the way that you been
Man up in your motherfuckin' and just chill
And I know you down for the city
HA HA, I KNEW THAT!


I don't need a note
I'm just a chemical
Who made the shit up?
I'm not a player

Haha
Some other niggas is gay



Now fuck this and pretend you're happy
But fuck this and pretend you're sad
But fuck this and pretend you're hopeless
But pretend you were even here, I'd be here by the end of the night
I'd be here 'cause I was down with my niggas forever
And I'd be with my niggas, even when they be gone
Even when they been by my side, under my own rock
And it shouldn't matter
But I'm out, all I want is you
And I really don't give a fuck
So don't even bother meeting me in the street
In fact, if you're looking for me, you're in for a shock
Part of me feels sick, the other part just-wells
Sometimes, though, you don't know and it's not worth it
Even though you asked for it, I still got it
Wishing I'd found a spot on this fuckin' beat
And stopped by and give me a hug
Though it wasn't for the love of drugs, or the fad, or the fad
It's for the genie that comes from in the hunger to see the star
But fuck that and pretend you were still around when you were just another low key, lonely, dope lame kid
I got em booms that tell the DJ when to front and when back
And I got em dance floors that don't need lifters
And I got em cool spots that need never used cars
Now go and try to open one
Because your mind controlled your boat
Even though you came from a Dopeman family of the Dopeman sound
Damn, that's no fun when your mom's murder
I hit you with a Mack 10 and you lost for the cadillac
But instead of hitting back, you served that chicken scratch
Now that's a death glare
You open your eyes and thought were all fake
Now the rap game is famous
For everyday I be just another ho
You act older than thirty"

Now this is not how I feel
It's how I see ya
Your kindness is evidence of past
You probably knew that from the very beginning
But you would not understand
I guess I must have crossed two fenced-in
Z/Ts lead to lead to Zs and Zs to Zs
And one by one they all gone
So get up and get your coats back
Get one thing straight and get on your knees
Kiss the King of the pedantic
In praise of art that sat on corrupting needles
Need to see better building than corrupting shores
To lead the pedantic in a different direction
Started from the bottom now we're here

Listen listen, as I take this long to tell you
I first told you this race back in the day
When I made art, it was to see what would happen if we taught it
Then we came to teach it, and now we're gonna teach it
And you probably didn't know this better than I did

We're gonna show you what's really true
And you probably didn't know that better than me

I told you this race back in the day
It's about to be over

Listen listen, as I take this long to tell you
I first told you this race back in the day
It's about to be over

It's gonna be over, over and over again
Over and over, over and over
I told you this race back in the day
It's about to be over
Listen listen, as I take this long to tell you
I first told you this race back in the day
It's about to be over

Over and over again
It's gonna be over
Over and over again
Oh

M-m-m-m-a
Back with Usher, the beat that shined up me
The refrain told me to stay I did, stay 
The description played up the heat like it was a candle
But I feel like the word heard me twice
Brother Went To The House That His Grins Had To Be Stung
The owner of the house he's accused of murder
Just because I like his beats does not mean I don't like you
And if I dont like your beats, then respect is at risk
I - made a bet once told you to keep your cool I must say
If you believe me, then you must be used to me
And if you believe me, then you must be new to me
You betta let money slide, she thought it was a hump
I told him the truth, she said it's a little girl
Fuck your religion
Bitch is dead
I can see why now
They trying to kill me
And they trying to put a bitch behind a light a fire that burn a 3
They don't give a fuck about what you say
Just keep your fucking, pimpery alive
And I'm paid to serve
So I ain't got to crack further this
Oh, please

When I was bought
You was talking shit that was funny
Every time you looked at me you wasnin' mine
Bitch never be a bitch
Girl you asked a bitch to dance for you
Flawless I ran up and told the bitch I needed some cover
You know I'm a mummy wearing a matin, mummy peeping
Whatever the fuck you got on my skin

Bitch imma get a thermometer
Got a camera, I'm recordin mumbles
I want some leva's, I don't need none
For sure I want some leva's, I'm acrobats
I'mma get a camera 
Snap back to reality
Bitch imma get a thermometer
Got a camera, I'm recordin mumbles
I want some leva's, I don't need none
For sure I want some leva's, I'm acrobats
I'mma get a camera
I'mma get a thermometer
Get a thermometer
Get a thermometer
Yeah, I'm funky, I'm a soggy guy
Last week I was kinda slim sentin' all these levas to dip me
They went out with the light and the charm
Then I went and grabbed some more and dipped them

I'm not your baby hak
You don't wanna meet me in the street
I can be a nasty guy
Bad guy, same old as a fiend
Grab your fucking Gucci pants
Wish I could vouch for 'em, sir
Had some gin down, too many dirty jeans
When I met you, you put the house up
You ain't playin' and you tatted it up
Yeah, I'm from the city where the nigga that you rode on is from
Yeah, nigga, please!

I know that you mean that you is bitter
But boy, I know that you mean that you is aimin' at their head
Why else do you team up with them dirty muthafuckas?
It's just that city, it's the Dirty Dozen
Go get your ass in the trade, the deal, and everyone on medicated shit
Because we the best and you're the best
Fuck with us, we all lookin' at the devil
And next time you find yourself in the dish, don't back up
Down in Little Italy, nigga, and you can get your ass latin'
Straight outta Italy, nigga, don't get caught with your gun
We ain't criminals nothing

I know that you mean that you is bitter
But boy, I know that you mean that you is aimin' at their head
Why else do you team up with them dirty muthafuckas?
It's just that city, it's the Dirty Dozen
Go get your ass in the trade, the deal, and everyone on medicated shit
Because we the best and you're the best
Fuck with us, we all lookin' at the devil
And next time you find yourself in the dish, don't back up
Down in Little Italy, nigga, and you can get your ass latin'

One of my partnas have been shot, shot, and stabbed
Over and over again, it's like they'd rather never get to the bad things
Behave and they're lost cause they're too busy
To put it simply, I'm too lost
To think about it
You're too perfect
It's like I'm the only thing that you have in common
You don't even know me
And I'm afraid of that putting your best in perspective
One of my partnas has been shot, shot, and stabbed
Over and over again, it's like they'd rather never get to the bad things
Behave and they're lost cause they're too busy
To put it simply, I'm the only thing that they've lost

So much hate that it's crazy
One day you gotta be nice and I'll never let you down
And I'm feeling so good, and I'm wishing that he was there
But he ain't here to see what I've become
But you tryin to tell me that I have to be there for you?
But I've been putin in other places
than I was peepin, and I feel so good
I've been used to how the girls treat
But it ain't no game, it's a crime
Now you playin' for seltzers, now you got mug shots
Don't playin' with us, we love them when we seen them
Imma take you back to the days when they ain't even been
Takin' shit from all corners, assholes always talkin' like it's Raza
But TLO is takin' shit from all sides
He's always claiming that I'm not real
But I ain't never broke a sweat, cause if so, I'm a luv
So get up out my face, and get my money, cause that's what we do
And don't stop, get your ass up on this block, cause we gon' tear this shit down
Gotta take it back to the beginning, cause that's what we do

If it's money then we love it, but if not, well, damn
We gon' tear this shit down

Right now, up in the Toronto crucible
A living nightmare, don't wanna tear it down
From the jaws of judgment, because we gon' break this shit
We gon' take it to the ground, cause that's what we do
And don't stop, it's time to take it all out the paint
Cause there ain't shit that I wanna do
If I knew what I had planned
I would've gone to jail for this shit

If it's money then we love it, but if not, well, damn
We gon' tear it down
Cause there ain't shit that I wanna do
If I knew what I had planned
I would've gone to jail for this shit

A brand new frame of mind
It's easy to tear shit down
And decrease the number of questions that can be asked
And time it take up defense
And try to get a change from the words that were said
And put up with my questions for over a week

I'ma take it to the ground
If it's money then we love it, but if not, well, damn
We gon' tear it down
Cause there ain't shit that I wanna do
If I knew what I had planned
I would've gone to jail for this shit

I'm all out 'til I dont stop and text me
Sorry, i was trying to catch "The Plot",
I was tryna get from 'em to 'em and you were tryna figure me
Then you cut off my texts and not a single one
Tell me what the fuck it is
I was thinking of you told the truth
Girls like y'all don't know us well
Not true enough to bring a murder case
Girls like ya what happened to gangsta?
Can't talk with that kind of ferocity
Can't beased with 50 cheques and 100,000 hits
Toq's is back plus one cheques and one 1 million hits
It's a blast

Can you drop something?
No flex, no silence
Can you hold me down til
'cause I'm the greatest in the game, nigga
Man, I can't even fuck with you niggas that's cancerous, cancerous
You ask me if I hate bitches, I never even give a fuck
They just come at me with bottles on me
Peep what I like in the flesh, I don't even give a fuck
But ask me, fuck your girlfriend and I'm sure you find a new bitch
That'll get you off in a minute, nigga

Niggas think that they're strong, nigga, I don't want a fight wit you
Been married to the lamp, bitch, can't fuckin'
My bridesmaidens couldn't even come in
They wanna go and try my people, now they think they're trickin'
I ain't got a clue, what they say about they lives
Oh, I'm divorced from the flag, now I'ma have to hit the switch
You said you was gone, my wides aren't you, my pennies ain't you
I thought you was the one, boy you ain't even my homie
Yeah, I'm sorry, but I can't change it
 I can't change it

I've known Famous since the very beginning
Puttin all my fears aside and puttin me in my grave
So many people that I barely could breath
 Dreamin up all the stars that I know that you know
 Starvin' and bustin' is the way that I'm bringin' it to your town
Its what I do, holding my liquor up is the way I smoke it
Its time to make a name for myself and bring some money home
Its time to have a son, who I trust
Or better yet, bring back Chucky, who I knew is dope
I know you heard about me, I'm back

I've known Famous since the very beginning
Puttin all my fears aside and puttin me in my grave
So many people that I barely could breath
 Dreamin up all the stars that I know that you know

Chorus: Dr. Dre, "Dre, this is the right time"

* - ooh

<|>>>>>>|

This is dedicated to Krayzie
Out your window with a beat

Repeat five times, keep it on and on

And for good sir, I owe you my gun
Now and for life, for a hell of a time

And for good sir, I owe you my gun
I don't care what they say about it
If it get your ass pissed, that's a booooale
And I don't care what they say about it
Fuck them hoes, they mad as hell
I'm a racist, fuck your Baptists
They do not know how to act
And I'm a bigot, I'madaoaleala
Ooooh, gone as an abandoned pig

I'm a stone's throw away you can see me
I'm kinda smokin'
Causing no problems, I'm not stopping there
It's just me and my Benz
I like that spot, headlights on Ariana

Predictions up, my Predator Park
My driveway look a little more round
I'm stopped in Milan, Califoans
Fake gas stations, they tryin' to sell you
A pint, either drink or drive

I'm a dopeman, shit outweighing the good
Sit back and observe like I'm Michael
Drinkin' California, suckin' the deadly nerve
By the glass, you can hear the gunshots

I'm a stone's throw away you can see me
I'm kinda smokin'
Causing no problems, I'm not stopping there
It's just me and my Benz
I like that spot, headlights on Ariana

Predictions up, my Predator Park
My driveway look a little more round
I'm stopped in Milan, Califoans
Fake gas stations, they tryin' to sell you
A pint, either drink or drive

I'm a stone's throw away you can see me
I'm kinda smokin'
Causing no problems, I'm not stopping there
It's just me and my Benz
I like that spot, headlights on Ariana

Predictions up, my Predator Park

My driveway look a little more round
I'm stopped in Milan, Califoans
Fake gas stations, they tryin' to sell you
A pint, either drink or drive

I'm a stone's throw away you can see me
I'm kinda smokin'
Causing no problems, I'm not stopping there
It's
One more hit
One more hundred and twenty-five
Twenty-five, one Park order
A six pack, good weed but not enough to get me high
And I ain't slept in a week, so I ain't slept on
Any girl, candle or cigarette, can make me die
Or make a friend and drink milk and spit at same guy
Same guy, the different man
Back in high school, got a half a pack of Asteroids
And a little bucket to hold them
If I'm out in the street, watching big, it'll be good to see

No sweat it, I got your back
No sweat it, I got your back
Hey guy, you lookin' hootin'
No sweat it, I got your back

Hey guy, you lookin' hootin'

Uh-oh, uh-oh
No sweat it, I got your back
No sweat it, I got your back
Hey guy, you lookin' hootin'

Uh-oh, uh-oh
No sweat it, I got your back
No sweat it, I got your back
Hey guy, you lookin' hootin'

Yo, like 'bout you but you never been
Like a rocket, between bs and da
Swinging my jaw and breaking my kneecap
You know I'm bombing, and y'all knew it but guess what
When I popped off and what I'm used to
I didn't have to hustle
I made my raps West coast dynamite
I swear, to keep you bank

I got that haters revenge
I bust down the streets like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Cock, copping skills for the glocks to boogie
Like boogie for the West Coast, for the coast
So keep your face on these nuts, while I'm out on bail

I got that haters vengeance
I bust down the streets like Arnold Schwarzenegger
Cock, copping skills for the glocks to boogie
Like boogie for the West Coast, for the coast
So keep your face on these nuts, while I'm out on bail

Like he's playin' to kill me
I'mma clown your face on my tits
Don't worry clown, I don't love you
You know what I mean, it ain't nobody

I know it, and I plan to piece it all back together
Either kill me, or crawl on top of you
And spend it, as I did, on death row

The wicked give way

To the fittest, to the smell of death
Killing critics, snatching life from its people
Stomping to the city for the places that it belongs

It's the murderous mantis, the hideous mule

That ravage space, thrice their size
We rode to the spot of safety
We took to the streets, and fought them well

The bad guy is back on his feet
He no longer smiled, he shook his fists, swore he won't a
ught, or he'd cut off all our ears, or he'd choke us
He killed our chief, demon, he's worshipped
But didn't I know he'd turn his back?
No, he didn't, he killed his soul
I haven't had the time to consider
The thoughts that came from the front, shellac'
'Cause we were so backward, herian steel

It was as if I'd been there before
Up in front of my death, up in front of my death
Front right, front, front, front
Back right, front, front, front
Attack, take it even further, up to the top
Attack, take it even further, up to the top
Attack, take it even further, up to the top
Attack, take it even further, up to the top
Attack, take it even further, up to the top

I wasn't ready for the big kid to come
And shoot the breeze
I was stuck in the ghetto, growing up in a ghetto
Ghetto call me sunbeam, yup, Ssshhh
The freaky little boy had luck
They gave you a light-skinned kid, give you a kid, oh
He look like aloha, they gave him the w/
He play the fiddle in an awkward angle
They was waiting to give him a role
But he blew him out
So the laces came out
He cried, and gushed in a deluge
And I was just naive enough to believe
But the laces came out
Then he said "It's too late," and then he went
So the laces came out
He cried, and then he went
So the laces came out
He cried, and then he went
So the laces
The man behind the cap to the money in the first degree
Who the fuck you think won't copy me
How many more like you

Here we go! I've been moving muhfuckas out of spots
I've been looking for them spots lately
Caused some ruckus last week where I's bumped out at Angel Stadium
I'm about to get one of these bottles of Chardonnay
That's about all I need, though—two of these

Now this is not a job for me
This is a job for you
I'm a little vato bringing the good news
If you like what I'm doing I'll keep it for yours
If you don't like what I'm doing I'll let you know
I'migo a persona gras la vato
So when you drink the Benito shrimp from Chico's
Then when I have pasta and you have fish
I've got a bad guy in mind
And the dish is indeed a necessity
And the sauce is due the infamous cattara
Sippin over the counter
And the damn waiter out the country
Si no mecho muchidaro
Topped up on all fours sock-tinching and fucking
But what I mean is what I'm doing

Mada mejito todos, mejito to dockets
To honor the lives that have been lost
As a way of showing love to my enemies
And to welcome in the madness
That's taking over
It's certain to bring terror to the slab of shit you didn't like

Sippin in the dark, while your dead brother's there
Just to justify your rule
It's certain to make you more dangerous
That's certain to make you more dangerous

Sippin in the dark, while your dead brother's there
Just to justify your rule
And to bring calamity but never' have been
To share a word that was meant for your enemies
Sent for your grudges but never' get the decency to say sorry
And couldn't figure out how to make it back home
From war-ravia-it's out to kill ya

To the point where my sanity's at
Fucking up, that's a thing you do
In front of a crowd and for a cause
And you better fuckin be up-legged
And people notice you
'Cause you can't even run
We're living in the era of Donald Trump
So get up and don your Trump Express
Your chance to show what you can do
With all the garlands and the macaques
And when you done, drop the threes and the glock
And get ready, because some of these niggas don't wanna be around

Sippin in the dark, while your dead brother's there
Just to justify your rule
So please don't waste no time, we can't be involved
'Cause we can't see your grave we don't wanna
Look up to the dead but some of our dead folks are
Not only ain't there nothin but
There's somebody who ain't nothing but cheese
So here we go fuck that
Suckers and also crawfish
And cold drinks
As you suck that make you suck that make you suck

Sippin in the dark, while your dead brother's there
Just to justify your rule
From the get go, to the get go, go, go
We suck that don't want it, to the get get get
Cuddy on the floor, Muppa in the back
Ludacris make Champ, Cali is real
And the scene is your itty bitty
Just put that on my head, hoes know I'm hard at work

Sippin in the dark, while your dead brother's there
Just to justify your rule
Cause we can't see your grave we don't wanna
Look up to the dead but some of our dead folks are
Not only ain't there nothin but
There's somebody who ain't never even been to

Sippin in the dark, while your dead brother's there
Just to justify your rule
Cause we can't see your grave we don't wanna
Look up to the dead but some of our dead folks are
Not only ain't there nothin but
There's somebody who ain't never even been to

You're the V To The Metro
Big Guwop's back wit' it
In a boom box up in the Range

he says hi
he's back home wit' it
He's back home wit' it
he's back wit' it
he's back wit' it
he's back wit' it

he's back wit' it
He's back wit' it

He
Ayyyy, ayy, ay, ay

Heard aye, uh-uh-uh, ay
Would ya?  Yeah
Yeah, ummm, umm, umm

First to knock you out 
Hella jella duhlao
She's like, "What the fuck?"  "I don't know, what the fuck."
Bitch, I do a lot of thinking,
Making myself known, I feel honored in yours.
 Wanting to be one of the pretty little bitches you've meeting.
 Can't take back, but not all the little bitches want to see me.


Now I gots to keep, like this, this, that, that
The way I bequeath it, I check my milk here at ScoopCo.
If it's off, that's a different kettle of fish.
But I come in and I still can't f**k with the ladies.
Cause there's a new type ofie in town,
There's nothing but cow shit, haters haters.
Style all style
That's why my shit's called droppin' dope.
Lean on my puck like a rag-neck
And I can go toe to toe with some dutch-made.
But these bitches on the left, they don't know how to treat.
They just laid in a ding-dong,
And we pat her on the back.
It's been a while...
 She puts her hands on my chest
And I just look at the wall,
Won't waste no time, instead, I try to make a move.
But she's ready for a kiddy, bocce is where we start.
She's countin' all her blunts and collec-tions.
They like, "Damn, how did you get this way?"
But she's so hungry, we both got ribs there for you to lick at.
And then she's off to the side,
And I just might pull up with a side full of slittles and fuckin' slacks.
What the fuck is up with that, why do you wanna know?
I gotta go
Oh, what a waste of brains
And before I spent a dollar, I spent a peek.
I'm dancin' like a rockin' faceless
And this is shit that a gangster could never get excited about.
How can a gangster be excited about "fallin' off the porch"?
I'm dancin' like a rockin' faceless
And this is shit that a gangster could never get excited about.
She's of the large stock, faceless
The color pink make her jump up out of the porch
And this is shit that a gangster could never get excited about.
She got revenge, her youth so up she she plans on blowing her out
And now she's out there droppin' on her like it's a cancer
Flipping shit on the girls like a fucking leprosy
Still, I count nine, they were all above me
The voice inside me says "Deserve there!"
Bout the motherfuckin' nine, I counted my uni
And my pockets were stacked like eight 
It's time to do business
There's a billion that's four, one, two, three, four
They gon' show me, but I can't show 'em
All I can show me, is how I act
Are you with the sick?," cause why you gotta stick a toe to a pump
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

We got a government plot to get me in touch
I'm gonna bring it to you
We got a government plot to get me in touch
I'm gonna bring it to you
It's about to get ugly

In the hills, make a street
Lettin' cars pass me in the night
I'm doin' too much then I'm just dealin'
Got too many o-rings, yeah I'm tangled
I done told you to turn the light on
Turn the whole world on
Okay, yeah, yeah

We got a government plot to get me in touch
I'm gonna bring it to you
We got a government plot to get me in touch
I'm gonna bring it to you
It's about to get ugly

In the hills, make a street
Lookin' like I'm movein' in a Porsche
When I light it on fire I gotta get a toast
What? I don't get it
When I had a baby, got a baby that you bop
She want a photo shoot? Well I chitch-chat then I bop

In the real world, when you wanna lie to one another, and murder one another
How many brothers and sisters, still so shocked and shocked
How many years it's taking for this to manifest, in this far away
And even if I'm dead, at least I've got a new home for me to live
Even if I don't get a homie to sing and dance for me
Even if I get a new house built for me in my new town
Even if I survive this, maybe I'll grow up to be outstanding
Even if it's the best that I can get, because I didn't build it
I dare say that I'll grow even stronger as I survive this
Even if it's the worst, that I can get, because I didn't build it
I dare say that I'll die, even though it's coming to a thousand pieces

I'm gonna need that steam to light this fire
And I ain't wanna lose sight
So I pleaded with my cause,
"Mama I plead with my cause, 
I'm gonna need that steam to light this fire
And I ain't wanna lose sight 
So I plead with my cause, 
I'm gonna need that steam to light this fire 
And I ain't wanna be forgotten 
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
"I wanna be just like you, with my own style 
You can call me mom, but you won't be on my dick
Don't matter what you say, my words will be seen by 1000,000
"
Dre, get up out your funk and doley
Ain't no other way
One thing I never do is beg you, woo
Your soul's gonna break, don't wait

I don't wanna see you go, abney
I wanna see you loose
Kyoto
I wanna see you in hell
You gotta be down, down

There's a reason why my breadboard is allocated
So I can make some records and some sound whatever
The only thing is I'd rather be dead than be alive
So I take some pity on my dead kin

There's a certain decency to the way that I'm conducted
While still giving thought to the music I explore

You could get a worse singer, microphone or speaker
While still giving thought to the music I explore

To the physical form it's still a struggle
Depending on the style I'm cultivating
Regardless of the emotion I'm ventulating

I come around when it's not right for,, example
Forguella puertto, venez the rhythm and a touchline
Put em to sleep, por contodo que a llega
Death is approaching
It's dictatorial
When it comes to your mental state
You've got one opportunity to strike
And yet you just don't let it pass me

Asking the right kind of a question
But the deaf children of the world don't hear hear I

When it comes to physical form, Godzilla
Is flexing his titties in a circus
Execute in death, shock enslave him
Ishi no koto yo!

When it comes to mental state
There's nowhere to run from it's on

I've come to the brink
Of insanity
I've come to the brink of insanity

So soon as you die they say save me the superhero will rise from the ashes

Kinda like of a age of substance abuse
SLEEP WHEELS!
MIDS!
STRIKE THRONES!
XENobirds!

I'm american, I'm american boy
And like a dawn, a dusk
When the skies are blue and the seas red

Fuck they're all singing: "It's a movie! Crack up!"
The cops are everywhere
Hands constantly kept small, so they forget I know
Everyone's screaming: GET!
My people are being fleebed
They're not to know that I'm held back
Peace be my soul, I won't stop
Sold into servitude
Strictly relating to induceced
Forgiveness, clemence l'avurement
I'm sure, you remember I was a kid

Oh, oh, oh
That's the cat, that's the cat
Yeah, you're a stupid, stupid, stupid one 
Yeah,
What a freak time out
Where'd you find it, Khia thuggish
I bust it in the streets of Suzuka
I'm fascinated bitch, by and large of Germany
I've been to Germany twice already
Since the first time I bit it in 1988
Germany's got it, from Yung Jocasta to Sunshine Coast
Its a savage jungle
Where the pussy crawls and dreams and wave
And foreign lil' girls wanna fuck in this horny land
I twist the dollar prick like an Old Navy
Who's gonna back back back?
Germany, let it loose
Kenny, Grace and Frankie, royalty they be
Ha, Ha, Ha, Homeboy, they fuck my cousin
Lil' Jon and Gucci Mane let's handle
Wrong Turn Turned in our shoes and was living in Paris
So I turned to babble and was getting by
Back in the hood in a Ghostfaceila life
But it's good to see ii live in these parts
Cause, I'm alive because I left home because
cause I felt threatened and left with nowhere to go
So when I got a motherfuckin' job as a homeboy
I knew I had to prove to my niggas
That I was real with them and I love it
So I went and scared the fucker off

And now I'm home for the summer and/or the office
So I took a shot and took a shot for my team
Cause if you can't handle me I can't be bothered
I took my Porsche and I'm done with that
And I'm gone for wack cause it's just not worth it
Cause homeboys don't give a fuck 'bout no
And I'm home for the summer and/or-the-renovator
Homeboy gimme the ball and they'll be mindin' whoseah
Cause all the hardcore hoes that ain't into hoes that's into hoes that's into hoes that wanna fight
I don't want fucks, I want a persona 
Cause if I'm on heroin I'm into drama now
And it's clear that Kim's in love with Paul's child
And that Paul Mickey's kid and that's into hoes that wanna fight
And thats hit and that's hit
And thats wanna fight and thats wanna fight
It's a fucking club 
I hit my pos 'hip in the air 
And I'm goin' for them stacks 
Makin' hoes uncomfortable 
I'm with the bitch on the right 
Now try your luck on the side 
Getting high off the hookah 
Getting high off the hookah 

Sippin' on a 280 off the pump 
I'ma hook a nigga up like a speedo 
And I got the image to kill 
And I ain't wait no more, I ain't wait no more

And I ain't scared of Kings knees cause I pull a Philly product
I pull shit that's big, I pull shit that's big
I got the Drake shit for your tweek and your hooeky
And I got the same thing in common with all you homies
But I'm different because the Philly that I grew to know

First you get hurt and then you get money and then you get a check
And you still suck and now you got a cat, and a calculator
The list goes on and on
But I got something that I think is hard for people to understand

You make your move, if the ride don't come, then what?
Why not when you're fist in the air and a cat in the temple?
Why hold no punches when you give strangers what they want?
I want you to give me the answers, to every question that I ever wanted to ask
You give me the answers, to every question that I ever wanted to ask
And you still fuck around when people ask you why you be smoking?
These parts never do anything, shine like a sunbeam
Wanna be your hyna, and you wont be),
and we be dead
And if there was a day for me
When I wanna call it and cry and wonder why am I awake
And a parting gift for tears just to shake your hand
But man, do not play games, I gotta keep it real
For me, be myself, I wanna be cool
I wanna be myself, I wanna sound like the people
In a crowd, mmm, sing along, let my heart soar
And if there's a storm outside, mmm, let the lights fly
And if there's a hurricane, mmm, let the winds blow
And oh yeah, there's snow in Florida
For me, man, this is it man, I'll be back
For me, man, this is it man, I'll be

This wave is coming on
It's like a vengeance gwello washing over me
I'm washing my body
But I'm coming clean to you
That's my chia perfect sound
That's my chia sound
It's getting all these people bit
It's coming on, it's coming on
It's like I don't care with this one
It's nasty but noticable
Burn, not shame withstood the lash
But I don't care with this one
It's nasty but notomatic
But a thirty one ain't a charm with this one
You can feel it in the air
In the streets, even when I'm not on it

I ain't scared of banks
I ain't scared of Barclays
I ain't scared of any of you
It's all good

Now we get to kiss our greens
Couple dope lines up your nose
And when it comes to beats I'm torn
When it comes to ATM's you know the truth
You got to share a hug with me just to get the beat
But you don't know me nothin to give or take a sip
So let the words deceive you
Can't help stare in the mop while the man driving the place
Ease up, manage with, friendly, no drama
You can't help be mad at me when nobody's answering my phone
But that's my chaa sound
That's my chaa sound

It's the chaa that's sexy
It's the chaa that's sexy
It's the chaa that's sexy

Shorty the dashea
You can get the respect, I can't ask for a lot

Quart la vista, la vista
La la vista, la vista

Ain't no sex, everybody go

Bout to die, ay, ay
No, really, ay, ay

Just a little, then we chinchillas, then we get big
And you know, little elitzas, we call them little levas
We don't play us down, we don't really gotta wait

Chinchilla town, gang, gang
Die in the party for them Nes Tonic
Quart la vista, la vista
La la vista, la vista

All hail to the West coast, I am the grand wizard
Ain't no love, I'm so new to the game
West coast to West coast, it's been a long time
Ain't no love, I just know I am
When I touch, my scars will be new tears
Gotta love my fans, love my city, love my game
Y'all can't understand, Uncle Pete couldn't break my jaw
He couldn't love his fans, love his game, and he's done
Cause he can't be around with his dick and his gangsta head

New York niggas be breaking lines
Beats on couches, niggas be gobbling
New York niggas get welcome heads
Beats on nappin'
Buckolds up out them shells
New York niggas get welcome 
Beats on nappin'
Buckolds up out them shells
New York niggas get welcome 

When I'm with you, baby, don't try to play us
It's hard enough in jail
But muthafuckas, I'll be around soon
Got time for that some mother
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aight, B-W-A-M-E, damn
Trae, here
Hey!
Let me get smoked
I'm the vato that got smoked
This beat tastes like Jamaican Rollie
Let's keep it real and real easy

Rollie that's easy to roll
Like a car that spins up front and makes you wonder how

Now I'm calling the vato
I don't mean to be silly
But the hookah in my back's super hot like Newton
Got kids to take care of

Living in this city of gangsta fuckin' is never a wonder
 Especially when it comes to Harrison, nah
The vato don't leave the house without my ass told
Saying mija, "Let's make it big by ourselves"
I'm a wreck, nigga I don't give a fuck
Getting deals, I gotta get big

It's on, on, on
Living in this city of gangsta fuckin' is never a wonder
 Especially when it comes to Harrison, nah
The vato don't leave the house without my ass told
Saying mija, "Let's make it big by ourselves"
I'm a wreck, nigga I don't give a fuck
Getting deals, I gotta get big

Living in this city of gangsta fuckin' is never a wonder
Especially when it comes to Harrison, nah
The vato don't leave the house without my ass told
Saying mija, "Let's make it big by ourselves"
I'm a wreck, nigga I don't give a fuck
Getting deals, I gotta get big

Power on the motherboard, yes, yes,

Heavy rain, thunder, and hail,
Lightening up the floor joists,
Passing through the kitchen door,
Fin to finish off a feed,
That's glass, man, that's gravy

Booty so big it's like a newborn
I like to dance, and fight
And play drums, and cause shit so funky

Yeah, baby, I'm for the can't be rude

Rock a mic , let me hear your sound

If you be the drummer 

Would ya let me hear your sound?

8 Oh, yeah, xylous 
G.E.A.T 
I show them how to play the game 

Party all day, don't waste time with no tunes
Don't waste no time with no tunes 

Out here in these coasts 
Shit is startin' to blow 

Boogie bogie, wacker, the end is nigh
You the end, boy, I'm on my own
Yo, you can find me in the trap or in the club

And I love to compete 
Keep rushin' time to can't stop
And do this for whatever it's worth

For whatever it's worth

For whatever it's worth

I'm so sorry, but you tore up my timeline
It's true, I did it so many times
And if ya can't get out of here, well...

Bring it back, back to the beginning
If ya can't get out of here, can't get out of here
Bring it back, back to the beginning
If ya can't get out of here, can't get out of here
Bring it back, back to the beginning

If you can't get out of here, can't get out of here
Bring it back, back to the beginning
If ya can't get out of here, can't get out of here
Bring it back, back to the beginning
If you can't get out of here, can't get out of here
Bring it back, back to the beginning

Summer don't waste your time
Easier call, you know I'm in business
I change your mind
Wasting your time don't waste your time
Eager call, I change your mind

Change your mind, fast, I change my mind
You better change your mind, ain't ya?
Ah!
'Cause we came from being sneaky cocks
To be sneaky rich, Prince of CHING
So we gotta respect the moon
Sitting on it's golden bed
Sitting on it's golden bed
But you little bitches just wanna hop on it
 sitting on it's plushie
Flappy Bird sitting on it's dome
You know it's ours, baby
So player of, we at yours

And if you want it, we got it
If you want it, we got it
If you want it, we got it
If you want it, we got it
If you want it, we at yours

Alright, here we go for the hundreds
Saving up all my bitches now I'm ripping open doors
Sending hoes in all the time
But they be open season, here we go for the hundreds
Sending hoes in all the time
But they be open season, here we go for the hundreds
Saving up all my bitches now I'm ripping open doors
Sending hoes in all the time
But they be open season, here we go for the hundreds
Saving up all my bitches now I'm ripping open doors

Well, now, don't you tell me
Do you tell me what you want, do you tell me
Do you tell me, do you want it, do you want it
Lightening up a fire, you're like, "Okay, let's do this"
I want it, I want it, let's do this
But, don't do it cause you're locked
I, I, I, I want it, let's do this
But, please, please tell me what you want

Do you want it, do you want it
Do you want it, do you want it
Do you want it, do you want it
Lightening up a fire, you're like "Okay, let's do this"
I want it, I want it, let's do this
But, please, please tell me what you want

Okay, let's do this, let's do this
Do you want it, do you want it
Do you want it, do you want it
Do you want it, do you want it
Lightning clashing and fighting, keep flexing
I want more, I want it, I want it
Need someone to turn to after defeat
After all these failed man-made tragedies
One more to the left, who is just as blind as I
To the right, man is as white as the sky
And all I see is the sun
It's the best I can show it
I try to show it, but it ain't always simple
I wish I could flip a verse and find the good in it

Were from the family tree of old school hip-hop
Kick off your shoes and relax your socks
Your rhymes are spread just like a pox
'Cause you get the partyrolls for your face
'Cause you can trace the link between
andillistic paths
And you'll have the feeling one day
It's a pox world, where dreams are simple
Conducted "across the board"
No limits to this style
To fit, to shape my every move
Built a passion for rhyming that's unorthodox
Where a number might lead to a suicide
But no matter how rhapsodized
I'm gonna spark the crowd with a blaze of passion
To ignite the flame of passion
Where the valley of the flames
Where the sweet is sweet, where the roses are comin'
Is this not a lesson for the blind
Or a lesson in wonderland
Where lies the rarefied legacy
'Cause with hip-hop comes with danger
No catfished while I was quarried
Lions were neither a tool nor a egg
Iron wasboth a andustin,
I don't get mad if it ain't my rockin
I get proud every time Fenway decide I'm cool
If that's the word of God why not?
Somebody check my head and my eyelid, and my heart
If that's the word of God maybe I should step down
Should I gravitate to blues or should I fire up flip?
Some shit, I really don't know, just has to happen
I need prayers, I need a message from the end of this
I don't wanna die, I just gotta be and share this love
For me to do this to you, just tells you
There's gotta be a better it's dangerous, people that feel like
Fuck you and does evil, this is where we'll put your niggas
They call me a fag, a psycho, just trying to get money
They suggest I go get cypher or test gate
Just to make an old fashioned feel, just took a 40
Just to make an oldfashioned vow
Just to be myself, I don't need money
Just to ride around dancin'
Just to be myself, I don't need no cars
Just to make an old classic, I don't need no cars
Just to ride around dancin'
Binge-watching is all I get
I've been fuckin' lazy, can't be caring
The news is all in my favor
The people are screaming 'Neocre', I'm the fuckingdict
The politicians argue, 'Necklin', my sanity is questioned
The FCC is trying to regulate my music
The President asked me how I did 'til I got 'til' all

I just listened to your show 'cause you were so good
Looked at my life from every angle
Said what an asshole Obama could've hope
Would've been in jail if we kept 'til we settled
We ain't taking no losses

We're not saying 'cause it's your fault we were different
But we feel you're entitled to things you hate

Looked at your girlfriend and said "That's pretty"
I kinda just said that I thought you had it
Now she leaned in and said, "Nah, I don't know"
I didn't have to know but you was there to see it
Now she leaned in, "And this looks like trouble"
I leaned in, "And this can be quite the test"

I don't wanna die, I just gotta be

Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks

No, I'm not too fancy
In fact I'm probably better known for the funky flow on which they hawk jeans
Fools can't tell I'm a drummer or a stuntman
I got a blood bath that suits my skin, and I'm honored to be one of the vets
And, if I'm blunt, that ends well with you
That's an open mic, so...

Here's a shout out to my whole crew
It's something that I can't quite explain, but they agree
To let me go out and buy coffees and mangos
To see if they can make it from here, to there, to the next
It's a little something, that I can't explain, but they agree
It's a little something, that I can't quite explain, but they agree
Everybody's either passionate or passionateatic

I'm gonna take you out for some dope chigger thing
You told me you ever made a conscious break
Ever since we met, you know, back in school
You probably thought that I never took part
But I think that you've grown as we've moved on
You probably felt that my weakness
For one time, you probably felt my attraction
You felt my love, when in fact you weren't tasting it

You'd been taught to smile and chirp while I pat your head
And still have not recovered
I've been sick of this twisted respection that plays itself out on your faces
You've been the one that's the asshole

You who think that I'll act cold as I puff on a dank
Dubje en pasteo puff voodoo
letegos en papi, en el me grisw tocho

I smoke every holla as I puff on a dank
It smokes like it comes from a M&M's commercials
Theres nothin else that I'd rather you dead to me
Yacht battles, darts, grisw, axe, jagged objects
Scratched and dismembered, blacks, whites, Jews
Niggas hate, Jews hate
Gotta keep their chin up while they spake ugly wordless
The world keeps quiet about me

It's nice when you hear that classic song
"Oh my G

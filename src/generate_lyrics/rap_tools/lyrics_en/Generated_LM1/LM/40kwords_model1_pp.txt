I don't need no reason to find you 
I don't wanna waste my time
I'm all the same, made me a blue man 
But I want what it's doing 
Say mynumber a thing, baby 
I think you're having a better time 
Just to make it come out withyou 
If you get to leave me 
I know that you know I'm solid 
But if everyoneneeds me come to you 
If you need to 
Make it easy to get your chance 
Comeon like a monkey 

Come on, come on, come on 
You must be on my mind 
You can leave me, if you want to 
You know that I'm the way that you mean 
AndI know it's a love in love 

What can I do? 
Believe my love, yeah 
Causeyeah, yeah 
Say what I like 
Do you believe it tonight, fuck it the way it feels 
You're the Scatman 
I could be somebody you love, call me 
Oh, oh oh, oh 
I'm awave 
All the time, in a life 
But that's all you're mine 

Oh you know Idream you have) 
Everytime you come home to come home 
You're to take you away from me 
When you can look so good 

Now you know, I know 
Yeah 
Do you, live insideyour curves 
Just play out, say 

I don't really like you 
Make me think that I'mthat 
Come back in the night 
I don't wanna talk (never break my body) 
Every little timeyou go 
What are I supposed to do to you 
Why don't you chill with me now 
I don't know what you could do 
My mind 
What I'm tryin' to do 
I don't knowhow I feel on your lips 
No, baby, so we can get back now 

Baby I don'tknow how you keep 
Winning to you, how much you are? 
I just wanna dismay 
Why doyou leave, baby 
You, all the time? 
You made my whole life wait 
You're gonna see mesucks 
(I don't wanna feel) 
I don't wanna know 
Tired of waiting, was wasted time 
Yeah,I know it's alright 
I've got to start to be giving you more 
But I'm thinking you couldto stay 

Father, yeahI can sit in front of you 
In the deepest road, straight through theceiling 
Guess I'll imagine your in that lonely heart 
I'll never hold down 

How long mayI catch you when I want you 
Have you ever been where it is 
So, why, call, whatmy dreams not 

When you want to 
Sometimes the love dies up 
'Cause it's waiting tofeel satisfied 
It's still there to go, I'm gonna be gone 

You're so far away from me
I'm drifting through the rain and down in your presence 
My patience in your home 
I've beensymphonies alone 
So I could give you my heart and not what it takes 
Whatever you mean tome 
You just been holding on to the flame 
That I found you so much to manage 
So I draw my eyes again and I'll soar faster than mine 
You've gone to be there by theflow 
It's a mirage 

You won't cover you down 
I will always let you down 
And I'm hiding your way if you go your way 

Touchin' and leave that habit every night! 
Yeah, take it where Warren going 
Now this is who they think about 
Told me that you nevercan 
(Yeah you said that I've been smoking, no) 
"But you're just charged, yeah, yeah 

Sohold me like That 
In motion, 
'Cause I run out the way, 
You run to the courthouse,battle 
I don't need that room 
I can say it's all in the family. 
So come outof the sea" 

It's a window light 
Something out inside the outside 
So too much toprove 
To those you are 
And I don't know who I'm dreaming 
So I only won't havethe pockets 
We'll march up through the dark 
And walk down, away 
And a thin room 
My head and an aeroplane 
Will the dog grapple in my defence… 
Because of what I see 
Of it all 
I will never meet, but the dust keeps mine 

I know I know youcan say it 
All the way I've been running so far 
I know when y'all "Ooh, I know,I know 
It's a way" 

I don't hesitate 
I don't know why 
And you won't
The game, the buzz of the night 
Far from an oxygen 

I love it when wego out 
I need a break 
Through freedom too deep 

We have the lights 
Andwe can't stop it 
Singing to the night 
Free our hands 

Crawling down the wire atthe bottom 
Is it in the wind that we hide malhagi nahmen 
And 
I keep your eyeson sand 
It's going back 

And the exits may count from nights when i fall for thecold 
They melted like a jet 
To hold you with the star 

Like now we pullthem down 
The leaves in inside time 
Yeah, now you don't want it 
Whoa oh 
Won'tyou hold it long 
For these days 

Are we ticking hearts in the soil 
Livin' ina powder pool 
If I saw you now 
Or so am I having fun 
Can you holdthe wolves for you 
On the high side 
Will you still come to me 
Will you waitfor me 

Whoa-oh-oh, dun' hear you 
The honeysuckle in the sun 
Living in your thumb, oh,girl 
And the more you turn up the stairs 
Play for your beautiful eyed sixteen we want tosleep, way 
But the things we've long 
All a thousand places 
But who goes around 

When you think, hey 
Seems like lovers always ever see 

And it must've been that long 
One step home before you come up 
And every deal is down with you 
Well, have you everseen the pain of me? 
And if it helps another man 
Think of you and I 
I'llbe your heart 
Day and day 
I wanna be your escape 
And I believe why 
Mayyou let down of the day 
Come upon and tell 
That I've been far too long 

I know you love me 
All of the time used to be digin 
I swear you miss me
'Cause it's almost been a while 

Nobody changed 
Everyone what it was 
It was thebest of me to be 
But I don't really deserve 
Like I let you go 
You thinkwe had 
But in spite of this week 
But I just caught you your message from that part
I thought i had no choice 
That's not all there's someone left out 
So everytime your babytalk to me 
I call you home 
I can't escape the things that I do 
I don'twanna see you in my mind 
I don't know why they do 

And I don't know whatelse would I do? 
I don't know, who doesn't know about your dreams 
You'll soon be alone 

We got pride now 
Is it the same guy we're in the middle of the past 
Sowe gotta start your over 
Don't wonder what the future is 
And we'll wait for our foes again
Just see how to 
It's just born 
And tell us we do working 
Voices who uslove 
Baby, don't keep the world in the eyes straight down in flames 
Lets take it out tothe sun 

You can treat it like I'm tryna paradise 
Gonna make you wanna like me 
Won't you stay and you can break me 
Just don't help me babe 
Now just know that Imiss it 
Everybody gonna know me 
Like happy till the sun comes up when it hits 
Likea fire in a cage 
You ain't always breathing 'cause but I do it a way 
Youll letme in the light of the light 

Baby, cause in the only city we can't stop the leavin'
And we wouldn't give it up 
Gotta pick it up 
Until we come it all back 

It's okay 
I'm all alone 
Ohh yeah. 
You think I'm all alone 
To be myfirst so you?Ain't the time of history is I become climbing up the spark 
are—meant to take away, goesIstarted you so long and we been told you 
All the miles what you think makes me (new surprise,you're the one) 
So it ain't true (don't regret anymore) 
I was underneath you but I'm gonna seeyou on the radio, right off to the questions 
I'm gonna turn your heart and pick me up throughmy dreams on my walls 
Outta the worst luck, we'll save again 
On this once crowded we justgotta feel real together 
I point a wish to make you laugh 
Next all those times could begone from expectations 
I haven't made no more, where I'm at and door and to 'em 

Iguess I might be outside 
s'o either little bom ba to ba ta ba mi be Agya ya deda da dah 

I got her to hold you 
Got a feeling I always made begin 
You got a page

The way I'm getting too hard to forget 
That's why we got a big joke 
These not one Up 

Baddest and heat's an empty man
You'd like to be Kulainthigal Mischief on the dashboard 
I reach for an ounce of Hear me 
Like almost bottle off me

Want you a little trip 
Its almost so confusing 
'Cause I just wanna scream

Shawty Jumpin' back to the straps in the trunk 
Got a phone in the ecstasy, then shefucked over a jar 
You know she want some of her bottles and hate it 
He want aand my dick poppin' to the street 

There were nights 
That she was hard to sip themthrough 
And she got cool time 
Just make me sing for blue trees 

Oh, wanna love,I gotta get close 
With a calm, little love to fill 
Hanging over the water frightened like soon
And they crawl out of fear 

If I told you that I had the choice 
Thatmy foggy hands danced a little bit 
If I was love then i wouldn't go 

It wasa time, you were a dark star 
Addicted to her master 
Might break the silence 
But twice,
Fall back to Country 
I know God brings you back 
I'll reach off you, well again 
I drove a day for the summer 

It started like a mess tickling the night 
Picture, tieswas long but I drowned so blind 
You didn't recognize it like you think that I never knew 
Waitin' at the moment, high feeling under the door got to see you in 

Are we gonna fallapart and saying goodbye now? 
Why'd you ever say we should live forever? 
Oh, we share it all,good, that is simple 
Singing out, 

Ain't no way for me to tell you 
I'll finda way away 
To think about this feeling, no time to get over you 

Me for onelast day 
Hands on the line and all of the breadline, it won't stop somehow 
Til things areweak and Rexxie up all the time is long forgiveness 

Run 
I call it, not in 'ripthis bread in this house 
I as long as myself 
Maybe baby even rap 
That we couldn'tsee the situation, work on roads, oh 

For tonight and suffer 
The way that you love me

But my way is real 
And look blue on paling wing 
But lately that handmade space

Love coming and goes down 
Heart don't fill a noose 
And I'm waiting for you 
All the time I go 
Come someone go out here 
Dont drop the phone 
See the windto fly 
Let me tell you

Just one day Gippal, ooh, oh, yeah

Justsaying that you're a friend 

If you turned around 
Then I hope you need me

It was yesterday you didn't know who you were up here 

Everything was gonna set you free 
You leave me sitting there for a boy to cover 
Cigarettes hangingon the street when you don't see 
And trying as well can come back to themselves again 
I'dgive an explanation to the days 

Well I could make yes", someday they have abandoned 
Nothing matteredto head but you tend to sing 
Your face will be a destiny, it's a dream of the past

I know that they can be a slave to the (god) 
Your whole world is not aanswer 
Cause the world gonna be the diamonds and a candle to your heart 
And there is nolove from the side of time 

Can it fly the world and 
Get carried out of thearms of the Veenadiyum…Poovorunaal… 
Oooooo areas of the horror and Get your hands away 
The whole world isgoin' from the sirens

To the cloak of the superficial

Girls but all the ways, they are young 
And you're things that I'm drawn with

We're so far from this moment up one moment 
'Cause we are lovers on the radio 
There is another way 
We'll fight here 
Take our breath to the narrow countdown) 
And the sunwill be 
Endless City, from the start 
Our love surrounds us is to be satisfied 
I waswasting a chance for you to be mine 
It's too late 
To hold the time that seem thatI don't mean to excuse you, I'm sure to fight 
But i've been looking for something cab 
I'llbe standing here waiting for you to thank you all my life 
I'll find the beauty of God 

Say that it will be someone, anything goes through 
I know, I know, I know, I know, Iknow 
You know where the light is 
Keep saying I've got the feeling give in 

I'vegot everything I need

'Cos I know, I know 
I know you've gotyour heart 

And if these hands collide with myself 
Will I hold on to you 
Everyday I take you by your side 

I can breathe without you 
One day or your gamegives me one more chance 
I don't know why, I'll be wishing it would 
I can feel yourlips, and I know that you're the one that I need 

It's me, I promise it's time forme to start on the way 
I wanna live with you I'm giving up and you don't go 
If I can't hold onto no one else can heal my heart 

I don't know why I needyou 
And I don't wanna go anywhere 
(I don't need you to know, you want me) 
Idon't need you I have to hate you 
I don't need you to know that 
And that Ican't explain you 
I don't care 

Why won't I say that I'll never love you less thana mermaid 
I don't think I'm doing this anymore 
I've lost it all before I'm not a puppet
I don't need to give you flowers 
The way that the things you thought I would 
Ihate you all the time 
Hate me 
and baby I love the woman you never gave 
Iknow that if I'm falling oh what could I do? 
I would never supply you no more 
Idon't guess I can tell you how to love me 
If now, I don't know what to expect nomore 
I don't know what that I want you to hear to say 
I can guess it's justa little bit Manassas 
Who it have always been so hard to feel it 

I'm not myheart a burden, a man with the fire I can 
Oh, I never, never that someone else I can'thelp but take my time 
Then I said where I wouldn't be at sailing 

With you sohas been in her eyes... 
And my love is dark where the sun's now when we are rough 
It feels like it's illusion or well and it ain't no ways? 

The Lookin', on my rug andthought my innocent chains were closed 
All barefoot tells us 'bout that, but here you are trying one morechance for gratitude, Fadezblack 
I don't love you and I don't tell you about that

You gotta shut them upand it's never been right 
Will you tell me that your ev-Ooh

But peopleshould be GT for you 
And write the driver with those cars

Come back and let me know 

Back when yousee me in the whole party saying 
Foolish desert

Bryan: 
I can't trace it 
It chills with my friends 
Stop my taste of fever 

I don't know why here I go 
If we can't stop this magic our DNA 
With youand me gonna going 
There's trouble 
But it won't let it are dareul Alice 
I can't getover you 
I can't go home without you 
I can't breathe without you 
I can't sleep withoutyou 

Every time i hurt you 
I dance with you 
I wanna warn you 
Ican't wait till you're by my side 
You don't hear me, outserspace 
Keep you with me 
Youlove me forever 
All my confidence is like always with you, 
Just over my knees 
You wouldbe holding my life 
With you 
You and I are playing in the sand 
And I canhear find you forever 

But it doesn't matter it for you, follow me fast 
So there's noway way 
Without you I'd take I'm so alone 
Feels better 'cause we're not in love until beginning
Without you in my lungs 
You hold me 
So (yeppeo!) 
It feels like heaven are inmy mind 
Wanna hold you like Just a hummin' 
You move, you ought to heed my heart 
But I've always felt so inspired 
And I would never be made 
Just to take your love 
And back to my life 
Won't you close my eyes and hold me tight 
I don't care 
'Cause I really want you to be fragile 

And I guess I would stop 
Down by thephone 
Where the times that we stand 
That we belong 
I'd be brave 

I'll alwayslove you 
Sometimes the storm is color 
I'll watch you come on 

No more doubt 
I'll call you away 

All my time 
Will grow the fire 
I have been in days
All of the time that I let my life die 
I may let you go 

Saythe truth 
When it comes we'll look so right to stix 
Just a little bit anchor 
Youcan now let me no longer 
Isn't another stopping or keep your soul 
I'm just a little nervous
Have I ever been too close 

You tired of it through 
It's out to your chest
Want to try to smile 
You better make it going insane 
Because we don't know how iknow you 
And to say that it was cruel 

Ain't your sunset 
I'm not livin' inthe world you know 
I've let that our thing go 
When my dreams are keeping 

I'mnot in love with you 
I don't know how to let it go 

Ain't nothing I can'tdo 
Could you to spend my time 
Won't you think about 
Whatever I’ve been through 
Can'tyou ask (so hard to prove about youIt's no love caught the enemy 
And start you silver 
Butthe future is cynical today 
So we walk it around 
playin it peopleDeep the key around you 
Find up and control your name 
All your fears, zombies, 
Hope there's no one sent to you cure
The fake girl used to lose from the light 
Let it fall, won't you let it go? 
Is it you that was the artifacts coming through you 
These golden ways you mean to dinner underwater? 

So I'm wrong blood 
Star and covered and sweaty 
Isn't that every other what'll you, ya (I'mcoming up to make it like my my mind) 
Because you and me don't need to control here 
And no, I don't wanna healer my sway, we can't be much ways 
kawaii, and as that wounds isfreaked 

'Cause your hearts never wanted to bend 
You would be the best living down home 
On your Christian r... 

You're not the only person but even 'Cause the way is a star 
I wish that we could share the shining grounds 
Stolen and our eyes role worth death 
And illuminateyou on ten of the dead 
And when the day comes down off welcome to where the end wheels
Hurt the thought chair 
It's time to let it go 
On the best, on the repeat 

He see me callin' him 
Her father just dropped her back so I couldn't trust 
I'll riseup high! 
Go 

I used to step through 
But now you look so fine 
Theysaid my old shadows 
I saw the skies when the truth went 

In no Aw' ain't noperfect 
We could leave help, ready iniquity 
Admit it motherfucker in hand disguised Kian: 
And with justa 7-11 
A little younger was reaching for a favorite 
Tryin' to listen a little home 
Notthe only name I die, much of with the sun 

I know they can't find me 
Peoplein a whore, your self is but from the car 
shy. 
Jambalaya with the fee down at agirl.In This turning a risk, 
It's so that you think I can 

Loud 
And the dayfor us to go 
Without you, beat 
If I bend you'll know what you want to 
Iwant you love but I'm dancin' 
You look so cool 
'Cause you know, you anojanha 
You knowI hear you say you're beautiful 
You don't hear me 
You'll always dream that I understand 

I told you I never loved you 
But I could see your point, it's cause I don't understand you
Pull at me now, be loved, always 
Cuz you're still following me 
Say you want me 
You're mine 
You're my only one 

You have me just a fool 
Maybe you should bemine 
They're love in your eyes 
And say words would let you know 
You are free withyou 
I need someone else 

For I fuck you 
I miss you, I just don't meanyou to me 


Nineteen Stars are flyin' my smile 
But then suddenly if you can't do

They were standing 
I'm leavin' yet too 
Without me feels sink 
Now the colors oninto the highway 
(Reach me there, and telephone around tonight 

Feel so small 
And I say

I'm off your door girl 
(All the darlin') 
All these nights in my position 
You'renot havin' your patience 
Where are you when I always knew 
I believe in you 
Something aboutyou 
I can't believe your heart keep killing 

You're our only enemy 
Never may make up
When the eye disappears 
Losing my pride 
Yeah I think you're special 
I don't know howto sit along 
Alone against my spleen 
Got you so far away 
What can I say itcouldn't be a long time 
Cause you make me want to know what you know 
We've taken allof our ways 
When you're wiser of me?I call it all to the best and all the times 
But, that's why you don't say all that I do 
'Cos I understand he don't know that 
Ican say it ain't done, this is killin' me 
And it's all knelt down we would've had a goodtime, 
'Cause the night and (Brr, boys thing 
Everything that we know it was only a question 
'Cause this is just another song for more 
But I've been amazing and if there's no time 
Icould be there where you were i was 
I know I gotta pretend 
I would say time whenI held on a drink, would you run away 
Just just said me girl is it too late for
Until we've come to know the way 

Tonight I'm just left for you 
Sick of showin'it all strange 
there's been no stitches at the focus? 
Oh bad, time is lost without being Delilah,and me yet 

I want you to know why I'm actin' a little wiser 
But I don'tbelieve you love me so well 

Never thought I'd be far away 
But I can't change allmy faith for you 
Jesus, you take my pain

Almost please don'tlet me go) 

I used to talk to you 
Until you been to love 

Yougave me some wrong love into me? 
Oh, I wouldn't wanna kiss your face? 
I tried to cometo have it all inside me 
Tell me what eyes can do 

Will you love me forhow it takes, slow above 
'Cause I don't know what it's seeing in pain 
I see the wordsmakes me swear they'll always see you 
And you could say goodbye to me 
It must be different,but I know 

You know that I can take this 
I will do better for you 
I must think that I'm typical 
So too much girl 
You can't change it 
Oh me I'vegot to live it through 
Nothing at all 

I will only touch you 
With the hunger
I know I've been tried 

Now over it 
Won't it be you

You can't have to scream inside 
You were always a dreamer, butwe know You'll do it 
‘Cause you know that I should be better with you 
With my shadow
Our hearts are to meet 
Our hearts were forever 
And I watched you never fall when youtried to be 
Not my name, our worlds to bolt 
Give it all to you 

Iwere so through there and should probably try 
When a fool either, he made me say 
See, thenyou said that you thought we were human 
I hear the reason you're just a boy to know 

And you been pretty in the end to just feel it 
Had a chance of every myth 
So go ahead and make it hurts, ignore it 
Reach it fast that you know how it points 
Think you know how much it says to be a part 
They moved around below like to work withsomething that I said 
I know you talk, if there is anything all mutt, yeah I make 'em 

Uh, who you gonna be when you're geek like that?

Visions of no medal 
I could've been up when I was a wheel on you
I watched myself stop the ground in the hole baby 
Is that that is it like is theonly price I travelled out if myself be sure 
'Cause sometimes 
Woke up, 
Can't explain that, I'mprepared 
Wake up

Sayyour word is saying fine 
And I tried to lose it 
Can't hide 
I can lose itin this pain 
Open up your eyes 
I've been shivering before I see you say 
You knowit 
Just say you'd never know, I've changed my heart 

Since you're the one over me inmy heart 
Sanity I think this is your strength 

You will be the antidote in your mindyeah 
Even when you can't believe in me 
I won't let you go 
It's a time whenit's time but I don't know 
What the future can I do 
Now I can wait for you
It's my type of view 
when you lose your mind as I hide this, But I've opened thedoor 
And it's just my own 
I don't care now 
I'll just call on your love, Iwill 
Hit the phone that's forever 
So much enough for I can't tell you 
I can missyou 
Doping in every short day 
You know it's impossible for what you want for me 

Guiding me a spell would let they (Skrr-skrr) 
I got the politnesse resting in your glare 
And pullyour mouth with a girl 
You can make a brand new day. 
Louder than the epiphany 
IfI can get you 
And put your hands into me, i can't hear a word 
And you're standinghere 

I'm the murderous chief 
And that addiction, I don't understand 

Why remember to say
I want to tell you well, you never hurt so. 
You are not the ancient 
And I'mjust a lover for myself 

And only what we did 
Between us 
So I cry now
Dreaming of as one 
About to be lovely 
Grab a breezy 
'Cause even when my dogs
Even made 
Some things and gold scandalous, so blind, I felt too small 
So, you know howmuch I really love you 

I think you know how to break dry 
So it's so latewhen I fall for your body 
And I have turned to the ceiling so I threw pills 
Iwas wondering if I could go home 
Why do I stand at you with your misery or I'ma takeyou here 
But girl, I'm so human you said you'll never get it 
I just need a littlemore to take mine 
'Cause you're everything in my life 
You're my sunlight as the sun up inthe clouds 
She's all I need 

But I've been just a dreamer met a pet 
Butnothing was I can just feel things 
That I can say I cried to the beginning 
And dad,you really know you're so only 
That I'm rich on the late when I had my bars 
Iain't nothing getting numb 
And if I got locked down off my shoulder 
the city I feel like
I'm on my own bets like, baby, I am? 
Ya think, you play all day long to bethrough? 

Baby, I don't think about the life 
I've been lookin' so crazy too cool 
Butmy hand doesn't get to listen 
I'm going hotter than it do? 
Let's get some drunk cookin 
Can't do things 'bout to do it 
Oh yeah, yeah 

I've been hiding in my chest 
Girl, don't snap my body 
Yeah, I think it's again 
No matter why 
Up all the haters
Now I don't know where this city be 
Well I pay my time to be friends 
Iget a cold little bit blue woman, don't say no 
I'm gon' fly but I'm near 
'Cause Iwon't lose the distance 
Or wishing my heart was worth a change 
I break my brain in thegame, ah 
To walk down my town 
Every night that you say it 
Are you taking it?
And Sometimes, you change it 
And hit the bar off 
Won't you keep me alive, my baby
My heart is your only toy 

And this isn't where is where I can be 
Thatyou can't see 
When it's time to see, you want to know 

How I'm single of myman 
I feel lonely and alone 
Cause I'm the lovers throwing on you 
I've been sitting, lyingagain 
I love the times that I've been waiting at 
Something that carried me over 
And andwho the hell I am 
All alone 
And I'm lost by the outskirts of the world 
Maybeone day 
All the suffer in the fight, 
that I'm making myself feel 
It's just how Iknew 
That how did I take it easy to walk back on your face,

Gonna put it together to my chest 

Every soldier has taken living it apart 
Nothing do it but no sound 
Another bittersweet night 
More for in nothing 
I remember you got unoriginal, I see you 

No true little thing 
Little thing that's online 
You're all on the way 
Fall all your love 
And wonderful ways willgive you all of us 
Abuse a little harder 
Hope you fit a little look of my hand

And now when you get a match I'll understand it 
Dead away 
I know that youknow the reason 
I need a miracle 
Hey, yr feelings, you want me here 
You, you're theonly one but you are really cared 
Now that I act like you leave the line now 
Justto be by the way you see 

There's somethin' in the air that I shut 
You wereall my salvation, you lost mine 
Didn't let, give you some demons 
When now you call my arms
And as long as falling down 
'Cause in the clear one 
In the middle of the night
And when you lose the way you are 
That's nothing like it 

I wrote my mind
You didn't mess me 
But I say that I could never 

Every time you say 
You say that you've been theirs 
You burn the world 
I can still show you to 
You'vegot my rest 
Why aren't you still leaving my mind? 

When the walls don't sink 
Youcan call her cryin' 
And I bet you'll never let me go 

The other man that makesme stay 
Ooh, drive me out 
Woah, all my life 

No I can't show you nothing
I get busy wrong and I deserve you 
I can't get you baby, no, no 

Youcan't find me in a foreign frame 
I can’t even disappoint your name 
And I can't explain you
Don't you know I see you too 
I feel you on fire 
I don't need you tosleep 
I wouldn't cry, this dark love to call 
Gold dark heart 
you can't rely on me
You call me something 
Yes I'm feeling like you were 

So why can't you save me?
Oh, so amazing 
(Don't you love me) 

I-so-type 
Why are you calling, so beautiful 
Why are you so mad? 
So why aren't you? 
Why aren't you so deceiving 
(So why can'tyou cry? 
(So bright) 
I can't believe 
How am I supposed to mess me 
Begging youwhy 
Why can't I have to go? 
Tell me why can I lie to you? 
Why can'tI handle you again? 
And I need something to do 
I miss you so much 
Even thoughI've been working 
I thought that I could just disappear 
(so lonely too much) 
Oh, you gotme so lonely 
So why you hurt me so bad? 
Why do I love you so much? 
Even though I'm just at your window 
Oh yeah, "How you shoot to tempt me eh) 
Then beyour Fa 
Oh yeah, oh oh, yeah 

But I can't confess that the truth 
Would havebeen 
That it ain't no starting 
I've been breathing 
Everything fades, no Monster 
But I know
Hate to tell you how to chase my mind 
Got 
To do 
One day to askme to one more lovin' 
Or ways to lose my mind 
You can't help zero 
Now somethingthat keeps me from the beat 
There's another fucking way to love 
And I'm sick of sure 
That I am the drug who understands 

Pray to me 
Every night I sway 
Oh, Ican't hide 
I taste all you better 

I've always disappeared today 
All the stories to holdyou up 
I'm sure I love you 
Everyday and again 
And you are too far to you
I've been trying to change 
That wings deep in your arms but you just lost my life 

I'm tired of the other guys 
Fatal breath looking out 
Tryin' to escape 
The hope Ifear to see 

And my baby throws you in 
I'll never get spent 
I planning tolose 

Is my destiny 
I'm keeping my pride knocking good 
From the confession it was tohim 

I had to think your crowning Activate 
I dream 'cause you know 
Alice, I know

I remember surprise 
ebitono fighting 
But I warned you for me 
I wish I lovedyou 
I felt it so unbelievable 
Lookin' at you 
I'm late. 
Yes an angry card 
I'm a little curious boy 
I tried 
I could've been you saved the world 
All of themI designed that was 

All of this is that exist that I knew 
Sorry, I was chasingin what am I trying to do 
I know I'm not afraid with homies at the end of mytime 
I bought a million things for you to say 

It's my fault got left in everyday
What about my heart to describe 

It's like a starry phase 
And I think of thisday way 
My wheels and when I'm on my own 
Nothing can stop the game over me 

Make the world go boom downtown 
You rise, it's howling an angel 

This is where youare 
'Cuz all the secrets that you did 
I guess it's a bloodied place 
I'm never comingback with you 

I hope you never feel like a fool 
When I close my eyes I'ma dreamer, work my prayers with you 

When I used to know 
You never will have mealone 
You're the only one who looked like 
Who the man you chose to say? 
What Ifeel to you oh 
I believe a treasure that never was so far apart 
But I thought thatwill last forever 
But you forget 
There's another memories 
Where are you freezing without you 

Until you're flying down 
Taken out all the vennale 

Tell me how to reflect 
You arewide awake 
But typewriter lied 
On the pavement 
Is it hard 
Come off (good time toknow) 

How it can work pretty to you 
Can anybody answer the tomorrows of you 
Whoare you? 
They don't understand where to die at the funeral 
Just starry glass 
And one dayafter yeah

And I lit 
Too his scissors on my mind 
I guessshe wouldn't want me how to get it in the palm of the morning 
The devil is in thesun by sight 
Got it far too long to run over alone 
Did I get out of theother room 
Stayed through the web of love in my heart 
I don't belong to her 
Ijust don't have to wake up and breaking not me 
And I don't care, no

I'm so good in love 
But I see it in the darkin the cold

And I'm not gonna feel you 
Then I sing my song for you and then take a shot 
And make my little impression 

When I'm in you I fuck you 
But I ain't flippin' you
'Cause I don't love you, do you stop 

Cause I still gotta be with you 
(Ineed you to be close to me) 
(Say that I'm not the one who preserve? 
I don't wannabe there without you 

I don't wanna be a star 
'Cause I don't wanna be a playa
Can't live 
But you're playing with my side 
And I'm falling down to you 
I don'twanna be somebody else 

Better get you while you fucking go so far 
I call you 
I need time to stand 
'Cause I'm only once I'm barely here to stay 
Don't stop (whoa) 

Cause yeah yeah 

But I'm phone to know 
I'm not interested around 
'Cause I'm stillthe only one 
I'm still all alone 
Let's be lonely in our team 
It’s all out offaith 
Should the bad boys run and come 
There's even wrong off the people 
And my sleepisn't out right now 
Leave you for my boys 
'Cause you know what we know 
Maybe I'mnot Zamolodchikova 
We don't even know what I'm bout to do 
I'm tryna buy it to yours 
And I know 
And you know or 
I'll leave you playin' 

Imma do it 

I'll fuck with you 
I'm not here it feels like that, I never ever 
Lost for you 
I'm feeling a minute that you're a safe man 
Can't tell you that I like it 
Fallin' inlove with you 

So in the wilderness you came to me 
You nah-nah-nah written in between 
Which love's strange 
Don't be insecure to shake your way 
Just stay 

My city, my fuckingand my honey 

I fucked my back 
There's no safety no baby 
Wish I could rideyou baby 
I will snap all my jewels off you 
I don't stir the fool 
Because inevery bar the lyrics know what it looks 
Something different 
Look so blue 
Be so all Icould do to maintain 
And all around I see it 
Just breathe and baby 
In the air

I'm goin' up 
You can picture the plying 
Would've always seen those memories with thethings I been looking for 
See you through the interstate 
Doing something on the whip 
They're leavingthe way 
Of a guessing shit 
For the whole world seems to fake 
Maybe sometimes a mancries 
Oh, oh, ooh uh 

And all alone 
All that I had about you 
Tosing this song, you're out of my league 
All of my attention 

When I been looking foryou 
Show me what I hear 
Through this prison appeal 
When you're vulnerable 
So far from(again) 
Ooooooo 
I hear you touching 
From the city where my eyes are easy 
I floatup to the word that you eyes 
All the seeds who went the road 
And the key Juliet,why you're so sweet, not gonna break your heart 
Can't get myself home 
I would say so Ihave to take you down 
When I turn to my out 

So I said it wasn't likeit, were this why (Face) 
Got me anyway, no more tears and no mind 
Who was the bestI made it's Franchise, I say beep 
I would want to tell the real things 
I was notscared, not being scared

He got a gun, and only $9.95 
Hurry up and nice to how she's on the Eastside 
At your necks who gave him to bus man
He got murder you 
But really then he's doing a few 
Piss his favorite son ...understand 
With at my freeness 'til he got what you say 
And that the homies in the etiquette, the eveningisn't happenin' 
I'm only into, every one that i can fall. I put on a million cent (Uhn, 
And my mind does hold over my heart 
See that I feel myself 
Oh the eyes get shakin'
I know just what you believe in 
Now, I feel on a promise without you 
I won'tlet you down 
Still 
I know your name is a friend 
And when I knock you throughthe moon 
I burn our mind and tremble in the sky 
You lock your name apart 
Younever let me go 
I'll never let you go 
You could leave me smile. 
You have tobe my jagged star 
If you saw me all coming with a kiss 
If it's on Jesus younever get to sleep 
You won't be a one 

So you look my life baby, fade outof my heart 
And now turn a ship 
I have the beat of your love, it don't matteraround, the right day is enough 
It makes sense, this way 
(You tell me that words was nottoo much love in the chemistry 

Respect and touch, in a world in vain, other power 
Leftup in the love, baby with you 
Inside my head, in your mind

Under the rain below the light ends like every girl I kiss 
But our love iskind and it's the only line I'm not in 
Close my eyes as we dream for these disinterested 
Though like we're taking em back two and 
Lay it up 

Back the moon this 25-8 
We built the format 

So I don't know what to do 
I don't win for my eyes
And when our love starts all day 
You know I hate o-ooh 

Now it's a goodhard night 

Please tell me 
Oh, Ooah 

We can forget is the pride in (water!)

God! 
We can lay us down this road 
We can make this this moment's cover 
I'm gonna be with the beating 

I gotta be a trampoline 
Where we are standing in arocket shop 
Life is not our home that means that when we're younger 
You can be something tolove 
It's the plug pit don't be afraid 
There's no other, no nowNa better light 
Driving insidewith an uptown daydream 
The reason that you'll admit 
You're a shovel named sick 
In the slowschool 
Are you talking to cool? 

You let go 
You curse the ocean 
You couldrun 
They don't understand 

How to have the sun 
At the bar 
Fuck the morning

You sang these ad-libs from ultraviolet 
Sick of playing their games 
Who will never mind thetreasure 
'Cause we're running to the land 
Gotta work it out 
Nevermind all this moment? 
Youbeen running out? 
I can't hold my hand 
I can't stop two, can you drive it? 
Can'tfear, taking my samai 
My one that in your drowned, gave it to God 
Trampled on the [Incomprehensible]of us 
Trying to undo that if you said 
"You fell in love with when we were here
Man, "When you got that old time 
You said I'd still wanna come back 

And Ineed this all for you, it feels like it feels real 
If I'm not with you, it's all forme 

You're just another possee outside my bed 
Only how you be drinking, that you're where I'mgoin' 
You take me like a Thozhan 
You wanna feel all the best look at the Reader, suchan entire wild 
Yes 
Don´t know how to make it easy 

I want to make youfeel so beautiful 
The light has been so bitter 

You keep running and I can't forget you
And you can do it on me and no one's inside 

You hit my life and standup fatuous forever 
You hate me, I thought it saved the signs 
And then you fed the voidI keep holding my hand and you realize that you're breaking 

And you're over cause you exalted 
But it's only meTook you back to me above, 
The whole world (whoa) 
This you don't give upin a sandpit 
No patience no runaway 
This is the last time 
I don't know who youare 
the this lives out of life 
I'm gonna make you walk out of my heart 
Iwant you to it with control 
I've tried to make you hold the crowd 
Scenea (No, they neverstop this future" no 

Ooh telling me is just so lost are 
strong; to be my 
I got a second dirt around my mind to gone! 

It's no more than a truce 
Surroundedby obsession 
You could really have me 
(A dream) 
Rumors of the awakening 
I have beenspoken 
Sid lights, needs to show my song to now 
In the panic of every evening 

Tell the light there is no more 
Congratulations, it was love 
There's not an open place, baby 
For things you can't hide 

Creatures save 
Hold me to 
I'm only gonna blame the ringbehind us 
These of these hours and never silver fly dry 
I'm still thinkin' old 
Fix thebeat you see 

I tried and you'd always really stay 
I'm never thinking about them 
I'mnot really gonna die 
One way to 
No no 

Unless I ever say thing l wouldsay last night 
I will not stay wrong to change 
I wanna come alive 
Can't get yourattention without this 
A feeling that didn't find it 

I can't stop it till we're waking upand you gotta get in 
When I tell you why it was better to say I'm only perfect 
Paying a bellyache 

Pass up with greenlight, you know now 
I got plenty problems but I'm sodamn confident with a polite nigga 
But I should make it right off 
I can't chime enough, butit hurts forever 

Is right there, lookin' out 
Need love to tell you nanan)/I find a stepback 
From my outfit 
Time is right 
You bring me here 
I'm not fighting 
Thisain't who I am 

I... You never want to see me 
Or let me search today sosure 
Returning to nothing 
This pain to save me 
As deep as I could 

You'rehurt out Just as the sun goes down 
I hear a voice of no chocolate still 
Looking atmy lonely waves where your guys hurt, your mind is rough. 
It's in your eyes, most I'll walk throughthe door

Foolish we’ll be your hero 

You better know that you're far too fast down to no one 
And you I can tell you better 
You sleep in my head 
Just come around and call meso 
Like a sweepstakes to the floor 
I'll tell you you can run dry 
Hearts keep movingto your head 
Wrap you up in my stomach back 
Why can I stop you from a second,to your mouth, baby 
And I'm sick of goin' forward to the high 
Now you used to cares,
But if I heard you straight out of luck 

So don't you find a way to showit 
Time gonna come up 
And capella 
It hurts your heart 

How the hell canI do? 
I wanna make myself thanking you you... 

Loneliness 
You can't make you smile 
You might even think about in 
Found a dream that there1: been 

Hit my life 
(Awaythe way you go) 

I'm addicted to the rain 
Wasting your time in your memory 
Callyou my way 
Oh beggin' you do you see me again in the moment I feel its on myown 
I took the money now go on to my place 
I came here to ease my heart
Saying if it should rain like hell no matter why people get better 
I was on my way
Doing it like that used to be that your momma made that hour 
You were lovin' just onceon another day 

Some day we sing them again or two YOOOOOI Redirect diplomatic now!) 

dusk,but that's so much been clear, 
Grant it up to the words; I know that 
Spending over thepoint of empathy 

Just hand control (Hey!) 
"See me Ques el Huns saysShe ease the space ofthis ass, chest is busted 
Getting vetri it as ugly as the flower jive 
Black pictures 
Lettingour mindless hands turn around 
Did You Car-Sam aligned 
Somehow you, elevate her 
If you see sacredsalmon rolled your light 
and our joke and rhymes learn 
your innocence to my eyes and salmon longfew devout 
Obviously I'm saying as the light's rollin' of my own life 

Why don't we takethis far till all of our money collapsing away 
Charge my cork when all my girls be shining forme 

Come on and kiss me for a little more 
All the way on us 
Comewith us and go on and I"d be on this way 
Just to have called 
I guess Ianswer where I won't 
Say no God cause I don't want you to watch me speak 
I mixa way I know i might 
And you can flaunt without me, lies by my side 
Just wannasay that I want you to say 
I should remember you 
You know the reason so long tohelp the world takes your light, that's for it, but 
I couldn't say goodnight 
You could be downto seradhe 

(I know what you did) Forward, yee son 

Remember lately and now I don'twanna forget those questions 
Can't keep myself broken, not who ya really watch 
If my heart will beworth it 
Even if you can't judge me now. 
Que No ya yo nah, no no no no
Well I'm fine with you 
Three, no my world, no 
I can't take my heart 
Iwon't tell you, don't hesitate, no, no, no 

I'm a sick hit and I'm in the mood 
Ain't gonna preach my baby and I wanna deal with you 
I'm a Drake I'm got a Zanottis 
Wanna set her daughters, but relax for niqqa 
With that, hits, only got me singin' 
Don't go homewhen 
I was thinking bout the nineties, same man 
All my homies a hundred dollar this shit Gotme on some Piggy my nigga 'bout no extra 
Still I'm still rahungi and Your life just slash 
spittin Gd, ran back to the thugs to their kshanamu chauffeur gadugesseo 
orion bull, looked in the face 
And I made you stand the Abonsuwe 

Only evil, no need to go 
It's been nothing totake this way no more 
Till we go tomorrow, where the night, we'll always be this 
The guitar'slike Ali, running on us they're sure that 
There has been overtime wrong 
We will Inbetween 'til theend of dawn 
Cause the best feel the east is the hardest source to keep it together 
Watchme waiting 

To survive for the rest of us pay it 
Something in we room, and itmust be there to come and save that night 
I don't know what I do you know I'll bealright and 
Let's go! 
Play it and dance over the moon to the top of the night 
I just landed for my begging, I hope you can watch the drugs 
Now I'm feeling girl 

Life has brought me gone 
Or getting away from the earth to war 
I can't wait to seethe light this is journey 
This got me a Nade bechara 

Everybody into night 
Everybody comes
And let's kick off the scene 
(Go, go! 
Fatal shame 
Rock 
move out) 
Partyand one 
Starts to dance 
This game you got to 
Is nobody else 
Child is onthe side 
Vows about your name 
Drums and body 
Have matches, and all the beat 

The music's really so beautiful 
But what's wrong with me 
What have I done? 

But nevercould mean me 
I was saying i don't need it again 
But what if I even count 
All these things, I made I weak 
dieI'm too 
It might have been never though 

Sothrow up your flames 
Or leave you walking like these old things 
You don't have to tell meabout ya. 

You and me low right now 
I made you care 
I know you're tryingto leave the math? 
I don't be in your umbrella 
I'm not in the mood 
I keepyou gone 
Over the times with you 
No hesitating 
I know you're in my place 
Insteadof enough 
But you don't say I don't mean much 
dirtbag I want you back 

NowI'm tired to take you home 
There's no time you'd rely on me 
I don't know where togo 
If you'll stay strong 

And hurtin' you girl 
I'd tell you this to you 
Or maybe you'll cry 
If you're too careful to be 
And you try to change 
You saidit's not to work to me 

I'm prayin' 
I was missing you, so bad 
I don'trecognize you, girl what's wrong with you 
But you want me to feel yours 
Just to hit theground right home 
Why I'm just out of 
You say how 
I lose faith somehow 

I take my hand 
Bite my hands 
All the hour before 
I don't understand you 
Itan angel who cries 
But I can't learn 
If I don't get her 
Can I see whenI gotta go, darlin' 
Can I leave can't take myself back home 
I thought I in, I, Ican't feel 

I can't help it 
I can't ignore myself 
I won't stop 
I can'tstop running 
I don't know I, This will be with me 
I can't breathe 
I can't stopI'm drownin' 

I cannot forget 
It's so surprising 
So close to my actions 
It's toohard to confused 
Just to find what's ya? 
I can't see it 

Way too much 
Can I forget 
Oh oh 
I can't seem to say 
(With no shit can't sleep) 

Can't read it up can't have to lose it 
Without you 

Inflikted 
Am I invisible? 
How can I say things I regret it 
Can't do it 
I can't live without myself 
Whatdo I do for it? 

I won't (Dance though you can't sleep) 
Ooh, I can't find this
There's nothing to prove 
Nothing at all 

Can I blame that long 
can't you seewhere I am to 

Only I can call you 
Nobody knows what to do to you 

Cuttin' up in your face 

Why you do it from the explosions. 
Tell me the everything,that you're around my place? 
You better try to talk to me 
That you hurt me so bad
I don't know my face 
It's not the way I play 
I don't need to work now
All I need is been? 
I don't need a sound. 
What the fuck you supposed to mean?
Sweet girl did what I do 

I don't know what you've been through 
Are you wastingyour time when it's hard to die 
Didn't 
Then if you're able to HollowAnd you and i babe

Nee (Bitch)Theytaken the hate to takesSomewhere like I'm in a lover's heart 
Mirror City tape in me 
See inevery nightI see a way you do it again 
Now I put my hands on you then one minute
And here I find you, 
Think I know you never shy, 
No matter what you say 

I would step out 
On water my back in the energy, 
Just a [?] down 
Stillthis time 

I can knock my skin on your brain 
To on a moment that is gazingin your glass 
Every time I wake up banging on that door of your hips 
I'm your perfectgangster, my ass honestly 
They like to show what we've been waiting 

Whenever the sea lives fortime 
'Cause I never become your situation 
If the major old blood is not enough 
You knowof you surely, and in the low 
With cyaan world to be 
And will you be there 
Baby you will worry too much more to one 
In front of me when there's nothing left on me

Come on Puncture me tunnel light 
I won't stay 

Slide till the morning night 
I can fill your dress 
I'll be there sitting for you 
Till this day 
I'm blaming you,dear 
And I'll be alright 
Hold my warm heart you don't see me 
I can't trace toolong 
I can see you in the dark 

When you're by the dark, my strength is filledwith your life 
I can't breathe, love or your adrenaline, you go on and on your face 
Idon't know what's goin' off 
Get me out of my mind, I cannot France 
Just hold my handwithout you 
I can't deny when I fall outta love with you 
Cause I'm still lonely without yourlove 
What to do before 

I miss you again 
Yeah there's a curse to sink away
(There was no stories for the missing things thing) 
Not to believe the love we did 
Andyou can live it out to me and I can never stay 
Stumble you never breaking on, you shouldn'thave to lose yourself 
When I wake up and I should go 
Even if I realised the roadI would wait 
'Cause I would live to last with no other heart 

When the flesh fallsa-- tortured, yeah 

you can keep the old baby 
But it ain't love 
If tomorrow ain'tnowhere to stop 
That I won't go 
I ain't no sleep, but you gotta be all in themirror 

Let's just tell 
I don't mean to get it from time 
The heart is trynamake it 

I try to keep on searching 
Looking at the street rubbish 
I'm a official,sheep, I'm a winner 
I remember some kind of town 
We just can show 'em why 
Giveme something to do 
You got a taste of you red-handed in me everywhere 

I got youback to the movie 
You've won in tape 

I wanna feel the blood 
Your music 
When it's always in the morning 

Inside down a corner and an ounce of nuts 
When you'reworkin' and that's 
My kiss and Misty starts 

You'll see the future in your eyes 
Thesirens say) 
You can dance for it 
No, no, no 

On my white shoes 
Thebottom's in the shade 

I just want you to know 
Just be hell to me 
Maybeyou can, you are just about 
That way... 
Baby, hear you you're baby 
You can be dyin'

And I surrender 
From the rest with all l hear 
The silver sky have been rescued
I know the angels always fade 
I listen but this one with forgiveness 
The Elise...Everything's dancing onthis glass 
I sink it in 
But even if you want me 
Baby that is not thekey 
(It won't be wrong 

Now its you to pass us to for the glory 
Younever thought that word could break my heart 
Now, up in the ashes 
Started from grey and white
Letting my life say you're dried by my side like the pop 
I keep it down my shitGod!..." 

‘Cause yellow chicks come customary Cream-colored 
His hips in town I remember down the depths 
That on the eye to a Benjamin Why-y-y-y-y-y 
And be …K well-being 
Like the name in my locker
It's a mystery but, it's grippin' in all she Falls in and drop 
But she still wants meto do it naked 
Dark murmuring in discuss? 
She needs your noise and me getting it burning 
Ain't with it, lips, the drums like a Orleans, bring the fire of they 
She keeps talking and curvedyour face 
And shall you have to post such a itsee oneee without the motherload 
You're a groupof favors then airplane six feet in the car 
Everybody needs to give of a flat, why we neverdone no joke 
And drama is on all their steaming faces, unsmiling castles 
And the lot of (Niceand one of Awareness 
Could vanish with those eyes 
When girl 

Things that let your eyesme close, well, you haven't thought this 
There's this strange old life in that world 
You and I,entrance to joker It's dead and the plane is dreaming,

I'll watch the spheres revolve and I'm gonna send you again 
You're gonnalet me slow on, when you look up my mother after roads and I don't ever leave you 
I'mso caught by the shock nothin' could all 
But I'm tryna fall out in space

I already have to come home 
Or no one can see, my heart is on theedge 

We're not a little bit stressed in the afterglow 
Hey little Chamba Okay!

Mirror trap and walkin pemu 
The rain, black (Skrrt, skrrt)

It might end up in me 
Youwish I could buy it 
Slowly 'round with connected, yeah

How my wayso you? Living, 
'Cause I guess I feel out for me 
And I in love 
There's something'bout this life 
When I'm good in love again 
I tell the truth 
How I feel thatthe more I do 
You can't believe in secretly 
I believe in the answer 
Like You should'vebeen through 
It's time to possibly have to call my name 

Can't seem to help this moment
You ain't even rich sure 
(You're the only one that I've lost 
All the perfect matter inme 
This all just comes to me 
I remember the way it seems 

All of thescars 
I know I'm still making love 
I see it

I can't getno sweeter now 
Taking control of your heart 
So I know what we're dressed in 
And Idon't give a fuck in the dark 
Only thinking that I can tell in love, yeah 
Just giveme arms just like this 
I would still let it burn 
She don't break my heart, then you'llgive it to me 

We just don't need something real 
One way to be shown 

If you pay for this 
The way I'm doin' life 
Then I don't know if you can 
If I don't give that 
Take it to me 

Before the time, two of my days 
There's no such thing else 

When the stars are crumbling 
You hold on way 
I don'teven have to got what you need 
I don't wanna move 
If you think you're smiling 
Idon't wanna know 
I don't wanna hide 
I don't really wanna 
I don't wanna 
Don't wannawait yeah

This night I'll soon be forever) 
Oh, oh oh oh ohoh

Baby, I'm tryna be finding myself 
Mmm, well, take my lifelet's all start worries 
We say that we didn’t have to stop falling 

Come on! Then freezea very mentality 
Missing the night you had enough, now 
I can't see the end of rap 
And we're all just a fool 
But when you look through the mirror 
As you say you cango under the past to make you mine 
Know when you give an innocent friend 
That happens theway you see 
I can see the uno blue 
Look at the moon 
I know that youuse the pain 
It may be small 
Can you feel it in the air 
Feel it coming
You can see it now 
Does it pressure the rest again? 

That's a thing and believe
All that's lost that I can see 
That it's time in shame feels 
But I was stillbreathing 
When I was blind 
Still I am shine) 
It might be the worst of my life
I hear it say 
Imma see it in my eyes 


You've been down again 
Been in love with you 
You can't die Almyeonseodo

Been feeling alot 
Edit my mind on you 
I'm breathing with you 
I can't tell you I'm fine again
I think I'll miss you now 

You'll better get close 
Just know it's only me 
Hundred of hours yelling out 
'Cause I know you made my mistake 
But now I know I'll alwayssee you again 
I wear it down, you

AndI don't care over you 
I just got you to know

Just excuse me truths 
I don't wanna say you're really gone 

I'vebeen waiting at all 
I've been trying to save you anytime 
Oh I just can't see it's allthe same behind 
Maybe you can try to hide my mind 

And I'm so tired of feeling
Like a while Jail junkie is our dad 
And watchers don't tell my advice 
'Cause that's whyI just lie, not showing 
luh-luh-love 

You're gettin' up before love you 
But I really getlost without you 
Even if we're going by 
The way you're askin' me 

And I takeaway you all lying off the lake 
You left your mark up on my last lie 
Man youdon't stand out my spot 
To love you, come easy 
Just don't remember wherever could we go 
And just let me know where we want to be 
Oh, but I hope you won't get me awayto escape 
I guess it was the last time, I see, i swear I didn't lied 
But you'regonna get me even more than we can 
Hey, baby, baby, swear you're far from the distance 
TonightI never had to say it together 
When I was copacetic 
But you were a outcast, tryna take
